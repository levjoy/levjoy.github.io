title: 'Hi there...'

---

I'm a campaign strategist and digital rights advocate. I'm currently a non-resident fellow at <a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/digital-civil-society/">Stanford's Digital Civil Society Lab</a>, where I'm building a <a href="https://www.digitalsecurityexchange.org/">Digital Security Exchange</a> to help connect digital security trainers to social sector and civil society organizations.

For more than a decade — as advocacy director at <a href="http://accessnow.org/">Access Now</a>, campaign director at <a href="http://www.freepress.net">Free Press</a>, managing editor of <a href="http://www.change.org">Change.org</a> and associate editor of <a href="http://www.techpresident.com">techPresident</a> and <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">Personal Democracy Forum</a> — I've helped lead global efforts to protect free expression online, fight for privacy and the right to encryption, secure strong open internet rules, reign in overreaching government surveillance, and otherwise protect the rights of at-risk internet users.

I hold an MFA in <a href="http://ima-mfa.hunter.cuny.edu/">Integrated Media Arts</a> from Hunter College, City University of New York, where I was an early proponent and analyst of the use of emergent social platforms for political and social advocacy.

I live in Northampton, MA with my wife and three kids.
