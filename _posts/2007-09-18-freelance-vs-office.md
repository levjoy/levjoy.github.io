I got inspired to write about the pros and cons of the freelance life.  The kind folks at Web Worker Daily published <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/09/18/one-blogger-asks-is-the-grass-really-greener-on-the-web-workers-lawn/#more-1140">my reflections</a>.  
</p><p>
Key question: 
</p><blockquote>
Does web work actually represent an evolution in the working conditions of the masses? Or are we fooling ourselves, blind to the reality that we can’t have it two ways — you can’t have the freedom AND have someone else, er, pay the bills.
