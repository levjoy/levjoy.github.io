We are fighting the good fight.  Injustice is occurring everywhere and we must take a stand.  We have a right to a scratchless iPod nano.

Are there really no better fights to fight than <a href="http://www.digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=business&amp;id=2707">this one</a>, a class-action suit against Apple for not making their iPod nano sufficiently scratch-proof?&#038;nbsp; The fact that this suit came about means that lawyers were hired, documents were drafted, and money was spent in order to sue on behalf of consumers who are simply tired of forking over money for an mp3 player that gets scratches on it.&#038;nbsp; The injustice.

<a href="http://blog.wired.com/cultofmac/">Cult of Mac</a> at Wired thinks it's dumb too:

<blockquote>The problem with having yuppie customers is they are so quick to sue. The  <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-23-2005/0004191257&amp;EDATE=">class-action lawsuit</a> against Apple over scratched nanos strikes me as petty and greedy -- even though I own a nano (scratched, natch) and am probably eligible to join.</blockquote>

Although I know I'm naive for saying this, it's absurd that in a world where <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/d008d71a7b688d992f2b5767fe2103a8.htm">this is happening,</a> people are obssessed about scratches on their near-worthless stuff and would rather act out of concern for their self-images of cool that are continually stroked (and scratched) by Jobs and co. than for something that is actually meaningful.&#038;nbsp; Citizen participation?&#038;nbsp; Wait, my nano hurts!
If you're still itching to sue, sue <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/10/25/MNGUOFDELJ1.DTL">Georgie</a>.

P.S.  See what <a href="http://notmuch.blogsome.com/2005/10/25/im-just-waiting-for-the-other-ipod-to-drop/">Rosanne</a> has to say about this too.
