<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"> <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Online retailer Amazon.com has announced the launch of  a new store: an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b/ref=sa_menu_mas2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2350149011" target="_hplink">online app marketplace</a> dubbed the Android Appstore, which offers a kind of iTunes for Android apps.</blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/22/amazon-app-store-debutsan_n_838889.html">huffingtonpost.com</a></div> <p>Beyond the fact that Apple is suing Amazon for its use of the word &#8220;app&#8221; (seriously?) lies the first interesting &#8212; and better functioning &#8212; competitor to the official Android app store. </p><p>I have to say, I&#8217;m not completely opposed to the idea. If Amazon can make the app store experience better for Android users, especially purchasing apps, it will be testament to the open nature of Android. More competition means more innovation, and consumers win.</p></div></div>
