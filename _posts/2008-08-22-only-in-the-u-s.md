    <p>From <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/49705.html">McClatchy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:14px;line-height:16px;">Obama has Ivy League degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. He's extraordinarily articulate and exudes self-confidence. Those credentials and qualities combine to strike some people as arrogant.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God forbid we have a well-educated, articulate, confident president. Only in this strange land of ours do presidential candidates actually have to dumb themselves down.</p>
