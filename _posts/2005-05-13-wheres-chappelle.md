<p>Okay, so we know that he's in some rehab center in South Africa(!). But isn't funny the way these news stories/detective hunts keep reappearing? Where's the kidnapped bride? Oh, she's a runaway bride! Where's Chappelle? The summer of 2001 was all about where's Chandra Levy? When a certain terror attack occurred, we stopped looking for her and starting hunting for Osama. Can't find him, so we looking for mentally exhausted celebrities and brides-to-be. We're always looking for someone. <p />

By the way, where the fuck is Osama? Every once in a while a story shows up that asks this question. It did today. And I love that the answer is always reduced to: Bin Laden is quiet because of "international pressure" or our military "success." Bin Laden is quiet because, um, if he wasn't we'd KILL him.<p />

Meanwhile, the search (and finding of) Chappelle is funny because just yesterday ads for his new, cancelled season showed up in the subways.</p>
