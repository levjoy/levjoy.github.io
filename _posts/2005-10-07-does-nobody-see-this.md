There may or may not be a real terrorist threat to New York (like there's been all along), but isn't it suspicious that this new one was announced on the same day that Bush gave his big we're-staying-in-Iraq-for-the-rest-of-your-lives speech?  From the administration's point of view, the threat underscores the reason why we're there (well, the <i>new</i> reason).  'We're fighting bin Laden in Iraq!  Whoops!  Terror alert in NYC!"  

I don't expect the 24-hour infomercial that passes for our national news media to mention this, but did anyone else notice, or am I just really very brilliant?
