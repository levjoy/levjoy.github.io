<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">US carriers have gone mad customizing perfectly fine devices and I wish every manufacturer had the pull of Apple to leave these smartphones the way they were designed to be used. The Galaxy S is a great product, but two of the four major US carriers have done what they can to cripple the experience to increase their revenues.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/cell-phones/have-us-wireless-carriers-gone-mad-samsung-fascinate-crippled-by-verizon/4617">zdnet.com</a></div><br /><p>Imagine you&#8217;re Verizon. Thanks to an aggressive strategy developed with your new bff, Google, you&#8217;re offering a ton of cool new Android phones from most of the major mobile hardware manufacturers: Motorola, HTC, Samsung. You can&#8217;t sell them fast enough. And they come with Android, an operating system that, at version 2.2, is easily competitive with, if not more advanced than, Apple&#8217;s iOS.</p><br /><p>If you&#8217;re Verizon, your next step will be to lock down the phones, remove the best software, and demand <em>more</em> money in return. </p><br /><p>What planet is Verizon on? Apple had good instincts in its quest to reform the mobile industry (to advance its own interests, of course) &#8212; create the hardware and the software, create a new class of hardware, and allow zero interference from carriers.</p><br /><p>But not every company is fronted by a Steve Jobs. And Google seems to have capitulated to the carriers after its failed attempt to control hardware and software with the Nexus One.</p><br /><p>Along with the carriers&#8217; fanatical desire to control for the sake of controlling lies another inexplicable need: To mangle &#8220;perfectly fine devices&#8221; &#8212; and a perfectly great operating system &#8212; without improving either. As Matthew Miller <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/cell-phones/have-us-wireless-carriers-gone-mad-samsung-fascinate-crippled-by-verizon/4617">describes</a>, once Verizon is through with hacking its new Samsung phone, the phone will be no better for the effort. Among other things, you&#8217;ll get a crappy Verizon maps app (that costs $10/month) instead of the great, and free, Google Maps, and users won&#8217;t be able to use Google search <em>on a Google phone</em>. Sounds great, Verizon.</p><br /><p>Also, check out the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/cell-phones/have-us-wireless-carriers-gone-mad-samsung-fascinate-crippled-by-verizon/4617#">comments</a> on Miller&#8217;s post.
