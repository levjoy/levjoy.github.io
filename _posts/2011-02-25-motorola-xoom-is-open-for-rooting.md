<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p class="NormalParagraphStyle">Even more remarkable: Motorola has provided the XOOM with an unlockable bootloader. Among its many benefits is that it allows the user to more or less truly “own” the XOOM and make any changes they desire, such as installing an alternative ROM set to enhance the XOOM’s features or even allow it to run an entirely different OS.</p><br /><p class="NormalParagraphStyle">These hacks are everywhere. Usually, Step One is to do a lot of hocus-pocus to get past whatever barriers the manufacturer put in place to prevent just such a modification. With the XOOM? Your money, your device, your risk. Go for it. </p><br /></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/3992213-452/hands-on-review-how-does-motorola-xoom-compare-to-ipad.html">suntimes.com</a></div><br /><p>Seems like the Xoom has an &#8220;unlockable bootloader,&#8221; which means that it&#8217;s rootable, which means that Motorola hasn&#8217;t included any security measures to stop people for using custom versions of Android on its new tablet. Neat.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-6365658095927272567?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
