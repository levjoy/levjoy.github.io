I just checked out <a href="http://www.nancyscola.com">Nancy's</a> blog at <a href="http://airamerica.com/">Air America</a> and saw that, as part of the weekend open thread there, she posted a pic of Satriale's Pork Store.

I just did a radio interview with an AM radio host and he asked for my prediction for how the Sopranos will end.  I said that a Soprano family member will die.  Not very insightful, but I hate guessing about these things.  He thought that Tony never woke up after being shot by Junior last season, and would wake up and discover this was all a dream.  Not very inventive.

One thing that will happen: I will cancel my HBO subscription after tonight.  The Sopranos is the only reason I've kept it; otherwise I just use it to zone out and watch movies like the War of the Worlds over and over again when I'm too tired to think.
