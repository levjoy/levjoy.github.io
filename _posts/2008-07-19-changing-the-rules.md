Day Two (for me) of Netroots Nation and I'm a bit fuzzier-headed than I was yetserday, thanks to free Chimays at the HuffPost/GQ party last night and an unspecified amount of beers afterwards.

But I woke up here at a panel on health care and the web.  Melinda Gibson from <a href="http://healthcareforamericanow.org/">Health Care for America Now</a> just showed a fantastic video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AndyCobbonUTube">Andy Cobb</a>, the web video maestro who's been on the election beat all year.  This one, however, is about health care.

I just loved it.  Maybe it's because of that fuzzy head of mine, but damn is it good.
