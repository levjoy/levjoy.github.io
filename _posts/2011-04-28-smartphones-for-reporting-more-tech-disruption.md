Turns out smartphones work great for such a thing. </p><p>I love how disruptive smartphones have been to nearly every technological market: They&#8217;re a threat to still cameras, camcorders, audio recording devices, GPS devices, even <em>compasses</em>. Yet within their own market, their still victims of almost no competition among carriers.  </p><p>We need to find a way to get these gatekeepers &#8212; who are busy finding artificial ways to hold back disruption &#8212;  out of the way, so that real innovation can occur in the wireless market.</p></div></div>
