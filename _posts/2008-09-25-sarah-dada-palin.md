I'll give $5 to anyone who can tell me what the heck Sarah Palin is talking about here.

Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=whats_happened_to_sarah_palin">calls it</a> a "dadaist trainwreck," and describes the answer as coming "from some dreamscape I've never visited." 

That's no dreamscape to me; more of a nightmare, for us and for her.   Honestly, this makes George W. Bush look like Abe Lincoln.
