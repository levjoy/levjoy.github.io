<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote><div><br /><p><br />And to answer everyone’s  question, the Verizon iPhone is nearly the same as <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/at_and_t/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about AT&amp;T Inc">AT&amp;T</a>’s iPhone 4 — but it doesn’t drop calls. For several million Americans, that makes it the holy grail.        </p></div></blockquote><br /><p>I&#8217;m happy with a Android that I can modify and make my own. And warts and all, I still think Android&#8217;s model is superior, and will be more so as the quality of apps and the OS increase. <br /></p><p>Besides, I don&#8217;t have the $600 to spend on a new phone at the moment. <br /></p><p>But I&#8217;m curious if there are folks out there &#8212; as journalists suggests &#8212; who only bought Android phones because of the absence of the iPhone. If so, will they turn on the big green robot and sell their souls to Steve Jobs?</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-3933565949027163734?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
