Every once in a while I remember that Barack Hussein Obama is about to be sworn in as the 44th President of the United States.  For some reason, that fact sometimes slips my mind. 

When the realization of it comes to me, I feel an internal shudder, like when you realize that something that you never thought possible is not only possible, but reality. 

This picture did it to me again:
