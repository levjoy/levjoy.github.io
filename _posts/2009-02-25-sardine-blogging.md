It seems I've got some company.  The fantabulous blog <a href="http://sardinesociety.blogspot.com/">Society for the Appreciation of the Lowly Tinned Sardine</a> has been sharing recipes and riffing on sardine-soaked history in great style, including a ton of awesome photos of vintage tins and prepared dishes.

Call it sardine porn.  I'm hooked.
