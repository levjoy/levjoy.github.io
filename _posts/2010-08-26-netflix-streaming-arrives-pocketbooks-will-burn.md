<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Netflix this morning <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netflix-app-now-available-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch-101550283.html">announced</a> that they&#8217;ve developed an app that will allow both iPod Touch and iPhone users to stream video selections from their instant queue. You&#8217;ll need to be a Netflix customer on a $8.99 or higher to use the free application, which will work over both Wi-Fi and AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G network (just in time to run smack into AT&amp;T&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/iPhone-4-Will-Mercilously-Obliterate-Your-ATT-Caps-108800">new 200&#160;MB and 2&#160;GB caps</a>).</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Netflix-Streaming-Hits-iPhone-iPod-Touch-110077">dslreports.com</a></div><br /><p>It&#8217;s not easy to explain why mobile data caps, which in AT&amp;T&#8217;s case appear to cost users $5 to $10 less a month, are actually bad for consumers. So consider the case of Netflix streaming. <br /></p><p>As mentioned above, Netflix will soon allow users to stream movies over 3G connections on their iPhones. <br /></p><p>I previously crunched the numbers <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/80372">here</a>, and discovered that someone streaming, say, <em>The Blind Side</em> would blow through more than 200MB of data in one sitting &#8212; reaching the cap for AT&amp;T&#8217;s $15/month plan. This user would be charged $15 per additional 200MB, or $15 a movie, which should be streaming for free (if you pay $8.99 a month to Netflix). <br /></p><p>People can always upgrade to the 2GB a month plan, but given our increasing data consumption, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before we blow through that cap too.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-7761397810834487091?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
