Deanna Zandt wrote up a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/99959/my_meeting_with_bill_clinton%3A_wall_street_vs_main_street/">long description</a> of our meeting with Bill Clinton on Alternet.  She ends with a good summary of what we might call the Clinton Doctrine: 

<blockquote>After meeting one of them now in person, the strategy of the Clintons has become clearer to me in a way that I couldn't have pictured just knowing them from the news. They strongly believe that the best way to make the world a better place is through the brokerage of power and influence, through deal-making and bargaining, through leveraging a flawed system to their advantage, and eventually the advantage of the underserved worldwide. I was familiar with the tactics before, and have heartily disagreed with them at many points, but through this meeting with Bill Clinton, I have a newfound respect and strong belief in their desire to make the world work better for everyone.</blockquote>

I'm not sure I agree with that last bit -- about having a newfound respect for the Clintons' leverage of power -- but it's thought-provoking.
