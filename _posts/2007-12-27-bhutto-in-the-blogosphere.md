<p>As always, I fired up my feedreader first thing this morning to go through headlines for today's <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog/entry/17195/daily_digest_what_if_the_candidates_actually_blogged">Daily Digest</a>. I found out about Benazir Bhutto's assassination from an unlikely source, William Beutler's <a href="http://www.blogpi.net/is-benazir-bhutto-the-next-theo-van-gogh">Blog P.I. blog</a>, where Beutler, a conservative blogger, usually writes about the 2008 election and conservative politics.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for a moment the fact that I tend to hit the feeds first before reading news from "traditional" sources like the New York Times, where I would have seen news of Bhutto's assassination front and center, it's pretty incredible to see the way her death instantly reverberated across the web.</p>
<p>Global Voices' Neha Viswanathan has a <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/pakistan-bhuttos-death-and-impending-elections/">superb write-up</a> of blog coverage of the assassination from across the Pakistani and Indian blogosphere, and the site has set up a <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/specialcoverage/the-assassination-of-benazir-bhutto/">special coverage page</a> devoted to online analysis of the terrible event, from which Pakistan and the world will be reeling for months, if not years.</p>
<p>Political assassinations like this are always world events, rarely confined to the locality in which they occur, so it's fitting that Global Voices links to posts from <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/venezuela-lesson-to-be-learned-from-bhutto/">Venezuela</a>, <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/brunei-prayers-for-bhutto/">Brunei</a>, the <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/puerto-rico-trinidad-tobago-pakistan-rip-bhutto/">Caribbean</a>, <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/singapore-remembering-bhutto/">Singapore</a>, and <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/12/27/cuba-pakistan-bhutto-reportedly-killed-in-bombing/">Cuba</a>.</p>
<p>As Chris Matthews and his fellow American narcissists* blather away as they consider how this might be good for John McCain and bad for Barack Obama, bloggers around the world are busy weighing the human relevance of such a profound and tragic event. It's too bad it takes the emergence of terrible moments like this -- events like the deadly earthquakes or the Asian tsunami -- to remind us of what an essential part of our lives the blogosphere has become.</p>
<p>*[UPDATE] It's not just the pundits; the candidates are also guilty. "The leading Dem candidates for president appear to be in a pitched battle to make the most craven and insipid uses of the Bhutto assassination for immediate political advantage," <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/062105.php">wrote</a> Josh Marshall.</p>
