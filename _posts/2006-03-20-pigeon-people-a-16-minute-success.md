I showed <a href="http://levjoy.com/video/pigeon-people.mov">Pigeon People</a> last Saturday night at Pete's Candy Store in Williamsburg.  A bunch of friends showed up and it was great fun.  It's amazing how pigeons have been a popular subject lately.  As everyone keeps reminding me, Susan Orlean wrote a piece about a 13-year-old pigeon keeper in <em>The New Yorker, </em>a PhD student who came to the viewing is writing his dissertation about pigeonkeeping around the world, and just this morning WNYC played a little audio piece about pigeons.  As usual, I'm on the burning edge of culture.

And just look at the handsome people that were so good to show up:
