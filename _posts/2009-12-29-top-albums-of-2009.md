    <p>"Everyone else is doing the top-ten-albums-of-2009-thing," I thought,"and so should I." <p />Then I realized, I already did it -- for a music sharing email list I'm on that heats up in the last two weeks of every year. <p /> Here's what I sent in. Nothing is revolutionary, and I wish I had more time to go beyond the somewhat predictable choices below. It is what it is: a document of my year in listening.&nbsp; Chime in with your thoughts and faves. <p /> -- <span style="font-size:medium;"><br /><strong>Top Ten-ish Albums of 2009</strong></span></p>
<div><strong><img title="61iSO5%2BUJbL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61iSO5%2BUJbL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="61iSO5%2BUJbL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><p /> Grizzly Bear </strong><em></em></div>
<div><em>Veckatimest<br /></em>I know, it's obvious. But when I first heard this at the beginning of 2009, I knew it would be my favorite of the year. At year's end, it still is. <p /><br /><img title="61rY6yM8HWL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61rY6yM8HWL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="61rY6yM8HWL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><p /> <br /><img title="41LGZb6XIXL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LGZb6XIXL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="41LGZb6XIXL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /></div>
<div class="im">
<p />
<div><strong>Animal Collective</strong></div>
<div><em>Merriweather Post Pavilion</em></div>
</div>
<div><em>Fall Be Kind</em></div>
<div>On first listen, both of these records were mind-blowing. They continue to surprise. Highlights include "My Girls" (of course) and the bizarre time signature of "Lion in a Coma" on the first album and the Stonehenge-inspired flute jam on <em>Fall Be Kind</em>'s "Graze."&nbsp; <p /><br /><img title="41gnovDi-mL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gnovDi-mL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="41gnovDi-mL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Bonnie Prince Billy</strong></div>
<div><em>Beware</em></div>
<div>A return to form, a year after the last return to form. <p /><br /><img title="51XdK3N5HRL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XdK3N5HRL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="51XdK3N5HRL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Dinosaur Jr.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><em>Farm</em></div>
<div>Another return to form, 15 years after the last return to form. <p /><br /><img title="51%2BtH930%2B8L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BtH930%2B8L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="51%2BtH930%2B8L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Dirty Projectors</strong></div>
<div><em>Bitte Orca</em></div>
<div>The first album that showed by what all the hype was about. The main singer/songwriter's occasionally annoying yelp is tempered by awesome harmonies from his three backup singers. This was constantly playing all summer long. <p /><br /><img title="41Ys6%2B8ikML._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ys6%2B8ikML._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="41Ys6%2B8ikML._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Fiery Furnaces</strong></div>
<div><em>I'm Going Away</em></div>
<div>Matthew Friedberger is one my favorite guitar players. Totally under-appreciated. <p /> <br /><img title="51WBw0YZBTL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WBw0YZBTL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="51WBw0YZBTL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Neko Case</strong></div>
<div><em>Middle Cyclone</em></div>
<div>Sophisticated avant-country that hipsters, housewives, and hippies can get into. The culmination of an incredible string of albums. <p /><br /><img title="41bqo%2BOj%2B0L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bqo%2BOj%2B0L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="41bqo%2BOj%2B0L._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>St. Vincent</strong></div>
<div><em>Actor</em></div>
<div>Another under-appreciated album. Seeing her live made me realize even more what a genius she is. <p /><br /><img title="51xvsB489HL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvsB489HL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" alt="51xvsB489HL._SL160_AA115_.jpg" /><br /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Flaming Lips</strong></div>
<div><em>Embryonic</em></div>
<div>A would-be return to form, if the Lips had ever actually sounded this murky before. <p /><br /><img title="beach-house-teen-dream.jpg" src="http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/wp-content/media/2009/11/beach-house-teen-dream.jpg" height="117" alt="beach-house-teen-dream.jpg" width="117" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Beach House</strong></div>
<div><em>Zebra </em>(2010)</div>
<div>This isn't actually out yet... but having gotten a leak, I have to add it. Like Grizzly Bear before it, it's already a contender for best of 2010. And the new year hasn't even begun.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Honorable Mention</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Built to Spill</strong></div>
<div><em>There Is No Enemy</em></div>
<div>Another semi-return to form.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Atlas Sound</strong></div>
<div><em>Logos</em></div>
<div>Some beauty mixed in with the filler.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>
<div><strong>Devendra Banhart</strong></div>
<div><em>What Will We Be</em></div>
<div>The major label debut from Natalie Portman's ex-boyfriend is much better than the reviews would have you believe.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Jim O'Rourke</strong></div>
<div><em>The Visitor</em></div>
<div>A 38+ minute long mash that could only come from Jim O'Rourke.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Disappointments</strong></span></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Monsters of Folk</strong></div>
<div><em>Monsters of Folk</em></div>
<div>Much less than the sum of its parts. And a reminder that I've never understood the appeal of Bright Eyes.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>M. Ward</strong></div>
<div><em>Hold Time</em></div>
<div>I'm tempted to say M. Ward is a one-trick pony. Ok, M. Ward is a one-trick pony.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Wilco&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><em>Wilco (The Album)&nbsp;</em></div>
<div>Disappointing on so many levels. Even more quaalude-irrific than the last sleeper. They're phoning it in at this point. <br /></div>
