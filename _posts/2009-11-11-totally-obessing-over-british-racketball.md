<p>I'm totally obsessing over British Racketball, which apparently only exists at Smith College, where I've been playing it every week. This video features the squash and racketball coach there.</p>
<p>Interesting fact: the British version is spelled "racketball." American version, "raquetball." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racquetball">Look it up</a>.</p>
