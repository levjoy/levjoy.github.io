<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">We hope that the next announcement will be that Apple will offer iPhones not only for use on Verizon but also on T-Mobile, Sprint and, indeed, any wireless provider.

In one world, a single, fantastic phone will dominate but be available on all carriers. In the other, a single, fantastic operating system - tweaked by carriers and manufacturers &#8212; will make its way to everyone&#8217;s palm.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-9186707630374843789?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
