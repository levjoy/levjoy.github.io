<a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/932">Personal Democracy Forum</a> posted this great snippet from Joe Trippi, former campaign manager for Howard Dean and architect of Dean's Internet wonderness:
<blockquote>Steve Westly, Democratic candidate for Governor, has recorded a three and a half minute message to voters and posted it on YouTube for everyone to view and share.

<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=OBU-iRBZhYA">Watch the message</a>

Already over 1,300+ people have watched the video this morning. With the primary election happening tomorrow, the stakes are high - can YouTube affect the election for California's next Governor?

I believe that the internet is a tool for communication that can be used to make politics better by replacing things like the thirty second TV ad with authentic messages and better dialogue. If this works, other campaigns will follow the Westly campaign's lead and the internet will become even more important to political campaigns. See the video for yourself and decide if this could be a better way to connect our politics.</blockquote>
I'm excited to see what the Internet will help us do <em>this </em>time.  After Howard Dean raised a ton of money, everyone blogged about it, and the rest of the pack played catch-up, how will people use the explosion of social networking and connectedness?  I'm sure Trippi will have a role to play.
If you haven't read it, get his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007ZNVCW/sr=8-1/qid=1149555008/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9758717-8309560?%5Fencoding=UTF8">The Revolution Will Not Be Televised</a>.  </em>It's both a memoir of his work on the Dean campaign and a manifesto about the political and social possibilities of the Internet.
