The $100 laptop was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20051116/tc_afp/unsummititcomputer_051116211654">unveiled</a> yesterday at the <a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/">World Summit on the Information Society</a> in Tunis.

We all have high hopes for it, but as I've <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2005/11/08/nicholas-negroponte-at-hunter-pa">discussed</a>, there are serious problems with the way Nicholas Negroponte et al. are framing the project.&#038;nbsp; Namely, there's no talk about how to get teachers to use the things other than the optimistic idea that children will magically learn how to use the computers themselves.  Ben Vershbow at <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/">if:book</a> has been a determined skeptic about the project, though he also wishes it well:<a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/">
</a>
<blockquote>Good teachers, who know computers, may be able to put the laptops to good use. But somehow I'm getting visions of stacks of unused or busted laptops, cast aside like so many neon bricks.</blockquote>I'm nervous myself. The stubborn reluctance of Negroponte to talk about pedagogy and content -- the things that may make or break this initiative -- is worrying.

Also, if Kofi can <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20051116/tc_afp/unsummititcomputer_051116211654">break the hand-crank</a> we're in trouble:
<blockquote>A slightly embarrassed Annan inadvertently broke the crank handle of the non-functioning model on display as he left.</blockquote>
Here's a <a href="http://laptop.media.mit.edu/news.html">link</a> to video and images from the event.
