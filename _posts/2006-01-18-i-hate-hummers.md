I really do hate Hummers.  One of my many pastimes is thinking up ways to softly harm them.  My favorite idea is printing out a bunch of bumper stickers with funny slogans and pasting them, irrevocably, onto people's Hummers.
It turns out I'm not alone.  This great site,  <a href="http://www.fuh2.com/index.php">FUH2 | Fuck You And Your H2</a>, is devoted to the hatred of Hummers and features an amazing <a href="http://www.fuh2.com/BuyPosterFlash.php">mosaic</a> of snapshots of people giving the bird to the hated Hummer.
