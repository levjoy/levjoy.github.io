Private life alert: I'm excited to let the world know that our son Arlo arrived two days ago (at precisely 2:31am on October 12).

His full name is Arlo Isaac Bourdon Levy.  If you're keeping score, his Hebrew name will be Chaim.  He's pretty cute, in my totally unbiased opinion. 

He came in at a whopping 8 lbs, 15.6 oz; the shorthand is a simple 9 lbs.  Perhaps for that reason, Nicole pushed for <em>three hours</em> before we finally got to see him.  But it was worth it; he's a wonderful little boy. 

One more pic, because I can't help myself:

Now, on to the bris.
