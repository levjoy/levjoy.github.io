<div>Below is an email I sent to some friends and family, explaining why our work at Free Press is so important, and asking them to support us with anything they can - $5, $10, $15. Read on for more about what we're working on, and how you can help.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>--&nbsp;</div>
<p />
Friends and family - I never, ever write emails like this. But this year is different. I'm now working at Free Press, a national media reform nonprofit devoted to increasing the diversity and accessibility of the media. Given that we are a nonprofit that depends on public support, I'm asking for your help.&nbsp;
<p />
<div>As you know, the media -- the Internet, TV, print journalism -- is the lifeline of our democracy. Left or right or in the middle, we all depend on it to make sure that we have the facts we need to make sound decisions at home and in our communities. No matter what you do, you need a solid, dependable media system to help you do it. And I think you'll agree with me that our media system needs to fixed.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>That's where Free Press comes in. We're fighting for media reform on several fronts, urging the FCC and Congress to pass rules and legislation that would help create fairer and more accountable media. Here are a few examples of what we do:&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>We're on the front lines of&nbsp;<strong>Net Neutrality</strong>, the fight to ensure that you will continue to have access to any kind of online content, whenever you want it -- without big companies like Comcast and Time Warner getting in the way. This is nothing less the protection of online speech. More here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#074d8f;">http://www.savetheinternet.com</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>We're pushing back against the proposed&nbsp;<strong>Comcast-NBC merger</strong>, which is simply bad for consumers and democracy. More about that here:<a href="http://www.freepress.net/comcast" target="_blank" style="color:#074d8f;">http://www.freepress.net/comcast</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>We're just about to see success in the form of the passage of the&nbsp;<strong>Local Community Radio Act</strong>&nbsp;in the House, which would bring fresh music, news and views to thousands of communities across the country. Find out more at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepress.net/lpfm" target="_blank" style="color:#074d8f;">http://www.freepress.net/lpfm</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>And we're pushing to&nbsp;<strong>free your phone</strong>&nbsp;-- supporting legislation and FCC action that would wrest power away from carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T and steer it toward consumers, so we can stop seeing such outrageous cell phone bills and actually have choice in the mobile marketplace.

<div>There's much more happening at Free Press; go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepress.net/" target="_blank" style="color:#074d8f;">http://www.freepress.net</a>&nbsp;to learn about it all.&nbsp;</div>
