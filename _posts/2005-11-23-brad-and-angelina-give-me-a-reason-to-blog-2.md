    Thanks to <a href="http://notmuch.blogsome.com/2005/10/25/im-just-waiting-for-the-other-ipod-to-drop/">Rosanne</a> for the tip about Brad and Angelina's <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051122/people_nm/un_refugees_jolie_dc">trip to Pakistan</a>.  They're doing good work, I think, though this Yahoo! story leaves something to be desired.  Nevertheless it's nice to know that
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Jolie and Pitt, who starred in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," led the field of People's Choice Award contenders announced in Los Angeles earlier this month with three nominations each.</blockquote>
