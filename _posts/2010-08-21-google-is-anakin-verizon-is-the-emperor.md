<p>Brooklyn Law&#8217;s Jonathan Askin gets playful with the comparisons. This one mostly holds up.</p><br /><blockquote><br /><p><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Verdana, Lucida Sans Regular, Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial, sans-serif;color:#272727;line-height:19px;font-size:x-small;">Over several years I took my nephew to see <em>Star Wars</em> Episodes 1-3. When Anakin turned to the Dark Side, my nephew was conflicted, but still loved Anakin. When I asked him who he wanted to win—Anakin or Obi-Wan—he said Anakin without hesitation. He had grown up with Anakin and a belief that Anakin was our champion. I suspect that many of us who grew up with Google still believe that Google will be our champion for an open and innovative Internet. Like my nephew, we want to believe that underneath Vader, Anakin and the greater good will prevail. We want to believe that Google will adhere to its founding principle: “Don’t Be Evil.”</span></p><br /></blockquote><br /><p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/21/google-anakin-verizon-dark-side/">via TechCrunch</a> </p><br /><p>But who is Jar Jar Binks? </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-4379223394445697102?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
