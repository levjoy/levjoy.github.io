    I went to Boston two days ago to help with a film about blogging and social media.  It was great fun; we interviewed Christopher Lydon and Brendan Greeley from the <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org">Open Source</a> radio show and they reaffirmed my love of blogging and my faith that it will continue to be a powerful force for democracy and civic life.

That was a boring sentence.

After my bout with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/levjoy/80671134/">pink eye</a> I thought infirmity was leaving me for a while, but instead I caught a bad cold on the trip.  I stayed in North Quincy the night before our shoot and ate a bunch of red wine and drank too much cheese (?).  I woke up the next morning with a vicious sore throat, the kind that usually functions as the shout of the Cold Army as it prepares for attack, but I shrugged it off. This morning the battalion arrived and I'm hurting.

In other news, <a href="http://notmuch.blogsome.com/2006/01/04/sad/">Rosanne</a> picked up on something that, before the pink invaded my brain, I might have picked up on too:

<blockquote>itâ€™s not too surprising that watching the news about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060104/ap_on_re_us/mine_explosion">those miners in west virginia</a> this morning made me cry.  but what is it about this particular situation that makes it hit me so hard?  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060104/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq">53 people died in Iraq yesterday</a>.  is it the old-fashionedness?  how can miners be trapped in 2006?  we dont die this way anymore.</blockquote>
If I was feeling cold-hearted (pun intended) I would say that, yet again, we have become completely numb to such a large number of deaths in Iraq yet feel pain when faced with a smaller number here at home.  But it's understandable, I think, because of what Rosanne said: miner deaths aren't supposed to happen anymore, are they? This makes me think of the great John Sayles movie <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0093509/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9bWF0ZXdhbnxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=20">Matewan</a></em>, in which there are fierce battles between West Virginian mine owners and the miners who want to unionize.  There is death and violence.

That film made me pretty much hate the mine owners. And I wonder if folks down in West Virginia are blaming the owners for these recent deaths -- the false news of 12 live men first originated from the owners.

Tonight = soup.
