Having spent last day running around school and being nutso, I missed the news that two levees failed in New Orleans, and arrived home to find pictures online of total devastation that eerily mirrored the photos of the tsunami devastation in Asia.  

I've been wondering, why do these things always hit poor people?  Or, why do poor people always live in low-lying, prone to natural disaster-type places?  Or maybe the rich, with their hovercrafts and supersonic jets, escape the areas in time while the poor must gather in the Superdome and stare in wonder as the top almost flies off. 

Meanwhile, a much larger disaster occurred yesterday in Iraq as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/08/31/iraq.main/index.html">at least 648 people died </a> after a stampede on the Tigris bridge.  Shiite pilgrims panicked after rumors of a suicide bomber on the bridge, and men, women and children jumped off or were pushed off the bridge.  

Let's repeat that: <strong>648 people</strong>.  

It's completely understandable why, for example, <a href="http://www.cnn.com%20">CNN</a> has let the New Orleans disaster take over its front page, and all of the links to the right and below the top story.  And as I write this, NPR is consumed with the news.  It is huge and should be covered.  

But in Iraq, a country that we currently occupy (remember?) <strong>648 people</strong> died.  That's a ton of people.  Maybe they could get the respect of a little news coverage?
