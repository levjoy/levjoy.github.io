    <p>Wow, I just stumbled upon the landing page for <a href="http://www.actionkit.com">ActionKit</a> -- an unreleased advocacy software package built by We Also Walk Dogs, the folks who built MoveOn's backend (which is the envy of many of us in the advocacy space). Judging from this elementary placeholder site, ActionKit looks like it could have the goods: fundraising, advocacy, reporting, APIs, social media integration, etc.<p />Looking forward to the release. And love that name.</p>
