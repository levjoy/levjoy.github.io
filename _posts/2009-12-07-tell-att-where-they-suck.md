      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">In NY, AT&amp;T's "Mark the Spot" iPhone app is going to run <em>constantly</em>. It lets you pinpoint precisely where AT&amp;T's network sucked, and how—dropped call, bad data, crappy voice—and send it to them. Prepare for a tsunami.</blockquote>

    <p>I love this. There may be other ways to tell AT&amp;T when you've dropped a call, had a bad connection or run into another problem...</p></div>
