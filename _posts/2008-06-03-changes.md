<p>I've Tweeted it, Facebooked it, and IM'd it, so now that I'm blogging it I guess it's official: I am no longer associate editor at techPresident and Personal Democracy Forum, and this week is my first full week as managing editor at <a href="http://www.change.org">Change.org</a>.</p>
<p>It's an exciting move. I get to work with Ben Rattray and co. to build up a social action blog network (and to help define what the heck that means), and to work on a project that I've admired from the start. It's a bittersweet move from the PdF world, but I know I'll be in close contact with those folks.</p>
