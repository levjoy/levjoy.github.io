<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">&#8230;the Amazon Appstore will be compatible with any standard Android app, and developers will be free to post their apps in both marketplaces. Amazon will perform basic quality checks on apps prior to posting them in its store, but otherwise its approval policies appear similar to Googleâ€™s.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/media-lab/mobile-media/113094/amazon-launching-its-own-app-store-for-android-devices/">poynter.org</a></div><br /><p>I&#8217;m of two minds about the multiplying number of Android app stores (Verizon, Amazon, Google). On one hand, fragmented app stores reflect &#8212; and strengthen &#8212; the fragmented nature of Android itself, which to my mind is a net negative for openness and innovation.</p><br /><p>Yet see the comments on Jason Kincaid&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/05/amazon-android-app-store-2/">original post</a> discussing Amazon&#8217;s store. Most are of the positive more-competition-is-good variety.</p><br /><p>And it&#8217;s true that Google&#8217;s app store is functional, but not very good. If Amazon can produce something that serves developers and consumers better, more power to them.</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-8504159752720791271?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
