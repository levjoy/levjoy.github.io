Most of you have probably (correctly) guessed that, in lieu of blogging, I've been, um, building a relationship with Arlo.

But one doesn't preclude the other.  So here's making a stab at a comeback, though I've been here for years.

The piece that got me off my butt: a typically <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/08/the-newspaper-indust.html">clear and far-reaching post</a> from Clay Shirky on the death of the newspaper industry, and the complaints from some, including Ron Rosenbaum, that they've been blindsided by effacement of print media via new media.
<blockquote>So I'm calling bullshit on the Rosenbaum thesis, because no one has been "caught up in this great upheaval." Caught up? That makes it sound like a tornado. This change has been more like seeing oncoming glaciers ten miles off, and then deciding not to move.</blockquote>
This one is making the rounds, of course, but I wanted to add my voice to the choir, and to intone the mighty creed: glad I work online.
