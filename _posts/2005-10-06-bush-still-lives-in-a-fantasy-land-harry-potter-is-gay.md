If we're to take his word for it, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/06/bush.iraq/index.html">Georgie</a> says we won't leave Iraq until we win the global war on terror, which means, um, never.  

Good news!  As I listened to him attempt to make a speech this morning, I was amazed and the number of false arguments he was arguing against, things like, "to people who say that people in the Middle East can't be democratic, I disagree."  Who says that?  Maybe some bigots somewhere do, but I've never heard person on the left or the write argue against the war on the grounds that Arabs can't be democratic.  What the hell is he talking about?

Maybe he and Laura the Librarian should join forces with the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/10/06/potter.gay.reut/index.html">British cleric</a> who not only thinks that Harry Potter is gay, but is also apparently advocating some sort of contest to figure out what the best media is:

<blockquote>He also described the villains in Rowling's blockbuster series as "wimps" and called TV "crap" compared to books.</blockquote>

TV: "Hey books!  You're crap!"

Books: "Shut up, TV!  You're crap!"

TV: "At least I don't have <i>words</i>!"

Books: "Oh yeah? You're mom is a tube radio, and you're dad is a fat nickelodeon!"

Internet: "Shut up, you two! I can converge you both!"

And so on.
