    The reason, of course, why I've been away for a while is that Nicole and I got married.  It was a tremendous day, full of love, though sometimes the sight of it all was obscured due to my inability to stop crying.  I knew it would happen, but I thought I might be able to hold things in until halfway through the ceremony.  But upon seeing Nicole and her dad make their way to chuppah, the tears rolled.  And rolled.  I couldn't stop.  It would have been inappropriate to try to thing of something un-wedding related to make the tears go away, so I tried to concentrate on the faces of the people in the audience, but everytime I looked at someone--Lorne, Ed Krasnow, my parents--it got even worse.

The ceremony was great nonetheless, and Nicole was poised throughout.  It was a pretty good approximation of what my life has been like with her--me trying not to get all gooey and emotional, and her standing by, oddly strengthened by the sight.  

There's more to it than I can say.  But having our good friends and both our families in attendance was amazingly life-affirming.  That did it; it's happening again.  I'm choking up.
