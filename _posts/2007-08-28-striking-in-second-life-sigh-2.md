    I know my <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/betterworld">thesis</a> was on Second Life and all, but I'm not sure what I think about <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/ibm_italy_strike/">this</a>, as real strike by Italian IBM employees in Second Life.  Isn't one of the points of a strike to make sure you're seen, so you can promote your point?
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">IBM has a widely reported presence on Second Life which is now set to face, at the very least, a picket line of characters that come straight out of the darker recesses of wild imaginings.</blockquote>
Second Life's servers usually crash if more than 70 avatars show up.  How exactly would this work?
