<p>The search for lost celebrities is a pleasant distraction from the recent violent protests going on in Afghanistan against alleged abuse of the Quran by American soldiers at Guantanamo Bay.  Don't worry; the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/05/12/quran.reaction/index.html?section=cnn_world"> assures us </a> that nothing is happening.  Thanks, Joint Chiefs, for the reassurance.  We believe you.  Afghans are willing to die over this, but I'm sure they're just being emotional.<p />

If this is really happening, my question to these asshole interrogators is this: why don't you <em> learn</em>?  These methods <em> don't work. </em>  In fact, they really don't work.  They turn people against us.  Oh yeah, and they're oppressively ignorant and offensive.</p>
