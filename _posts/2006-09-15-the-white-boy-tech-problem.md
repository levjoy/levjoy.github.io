<p>
Chris Messina, a tech consultant who blogs at <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">FactoryCity </a>and was once on the <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> team, wrote a great post today about the whiteness and maleness of the Web 2.0 world.  He says things that many white men don't have the nards to say.
</p><blockquote>
as it stands, we, as white men (of course I include myself in that), have a tremendous amount of privilege and power — power that many of us don’t know we have, power that many of us choose to ignore, power that some of us disclaim or shrug off. The utter reality is that whether you want it or not, you have the power and the potential to be part of the ongoing solution.
</blockquote><p>
I think it's manly to admit as much, and unmanly to pretend otherwise.
