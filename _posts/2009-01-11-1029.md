I love this, via <a href="http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/blog/2009/01/01/blogging-the-dream-dreaming-to-blog/">Global Voices</a>:

<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.orizonturi.org/">Orizonturi Foundation</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2mpulung_Moldovenesc">Campulung Moldovenesc</a>, Romania has been helping people with mental health issues since 1995. Its citizen media initiative the “<a href="http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/blogging-the-dream/">Blogging the dream project</a>” created a blogging club for mental health service users with the help of a Rising Voices micro grant. It trains them how to maintain a weblog, upload videos to online sharing sites, and use social networks. With these blogs these people are voicing their opinions and hope to break through stigma barriers, fight discrimination, and create awareness of mental health problems.</blockquote>

Reminds me of my own <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/bronxblogproject">Bronx Blog Project</a> except with money and a bit more (ok, a lot more) focus and need.  Good luck folks!
