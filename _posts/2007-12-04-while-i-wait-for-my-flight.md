Yesterday I had the chance to see John McCain at a MTV and MySpace co-sponsored event in Manchester, NH (liveblogging and coverage <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog/entry/14614/liveblogging_the_mtv_myspace_dialogue_with_john_mccain">here</a> and <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog/entry/14653/mccain_mtv_myspace_post_mortem">here</a>).&nbsp; These events are pretty much updates of the old townhall "boxers or briefs"&nbsp; TV forums MTV put on in the '90s, with a really innovative use of the web.&nbsp; 

Anyway, you can read about that at tPrez.

Here's a pic of some bald dude... oh no, that's me at the event, furiously blogging away!

Micah had the idea of posting a photo to Flickr of me updating Twitter about my liveblog and posting that to Facebook.&nbsp; Here's the fruits of that idea, courtesy of Bob Brigham.
