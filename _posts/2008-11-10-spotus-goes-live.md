I've only had <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/09/05/community-funded-reporting-a-success/">nice things</a> to say about my friend David Cohn's journalistic venture <a href="http://www.spot.us/">Spot.us</a>, and I'm thrilled  that today marks the official launch of his project.

The premise of Spot.us is simple: journalists pitch a story, a community finds it important to fund that story, a campaign is built to commission it, and it gets written.   <a href="http://www.digidave.org/adventures_in_freelancing/2008/11/launching-the-s.html">Writes</a> David:

<blockquote>The process of journalism should be participatory - and perhaps one way it can be made participatory is if the public has the opportunity to commission the journalism they want to see.</blockquote>

Sounds simple, but it's a quietly revolutionary way of circumscribing the existing media economy.  With our help, it could be a big success, and it could inspire other similar projects.   Good luck David!
