I'm still catching up from being away from the blogosphere for a few days, and thus still reading some fascinating news about the election in Mexico.  Although Calderon is the "official" winner, Obrador is <a href="http://vivirlatino.com/2006/07/10/lopez-obrador-brings-together-half-a-million-mexicans.php">rallying his supporters</a> and it looks like this won't end for a while.  I promise to keep better tabs on it.

Also, after watching Italy beat France yesterday and only learning about the great Zidane yesterday morning, it was totally upsetting to watch him head-butt an Italian player and get thrown out of his last football game ever.  It was a vicious head-butt, though, which makes me wonder what the Italian player said to him.
