A bunch of relief will start <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2005/07/30/nigers_silent_emergency.html">flowing in</a> to Niger soon.  The pictures of starving African children have worked.  I can't wait until the next famine, when we can see a whole new round of horrifying pictures trying their best to jostle us from our slumber.  

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/07/31/india.flood/index.html?section=cnn_world">Mumbai</a>, though, is a little boring, isn't it?  Indians drown in monsoon waters all the time, don't they?  

As I've posted <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/2005/05/wheres-chappelle/">before</a>, we all love a good missing-person story.  So it's sad to see <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/31/aruba.missing/index.html">this one</a> end.  But really, in the face of more pressing emergencies, should this really get this kind of repeated attention? As it is, in Niger alone there's a possible threat to <i>one million</i> people's lives, but the story of this missing girl and her mother gets repeated attention.  

The story was good, however, for this fantastic, off-the-cuff haiku spoken by the lead investigator in the case:

<blockquote>The search at the pond is over," Roy Trump told CNN. "It's unfortunate, of course, but there was nothing there. We're finished at the pond."</blockquote> 

Let's roll that out in poem form:

The search at the pond is over,
It's unfortunate, of course,
but there was nothing there.
We're finished at the pond.
