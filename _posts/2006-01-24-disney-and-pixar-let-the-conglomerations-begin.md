So Disney and Pixar are now one.&nbsp; I haven't scavenged the web for people's reactions to this.&nbsp; But I'm worried that it means that, effectively, Disney and Apple are now closer than close, since Steve Jobs is head of both Pixar and Apple.&nbsp; So Apple will start offering Disney content over other companies', Mickey Mouse will be the new mascot for Apple.<br /><br />I can't wait for the Disneyworld iPod shuffle ride. <br /><br /><br /><br />Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/apple" rel="tag">apple</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/disney" rel="tag">disney</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/pixar" rel="tag">pixar</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/steve%20jobs" rel="tag">steve jobs</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ipod" rel="tag">ipod</a>
