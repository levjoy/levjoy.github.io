I was recently <a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=args88bab.0.elgv88bab.viju67n6.1863&amp;ts=S0226&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FPolitics%2Fstory%3Fid%3D2809023%26amp%3Bpage%3D1">interviewed</a> by ABCnews.com about Second Life and politics, which was fun, and <a href="http://letsbeserious.wordpress.com/">Erica Sagrans</a>, who I met at the RootsCamp conference in DC a few months back, wrote a great <a href="http://thephoenix.com/Article.aspx?id=32823&amp;page=1">piece</a> about new technologies politics and I'm, ahem, quoted in that too.  Check them both out!
