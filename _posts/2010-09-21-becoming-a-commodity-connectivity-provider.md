<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Verizon is essentially making Verizon Android phones different from all other Android phones.  Say I buy an app through the V CAST app store then a year down the line I buy another Android device on Sprint. Guess what? It won’t work on the new device.</blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/21/verizon-v-cast-apps/">techcrunch.com</a></div><br /><p>Verizon makes the clichéd argument that its breakaway app store is all about &#8220;choice.&#8221; <br /></p><p>James Kendrick nails it when he says Verizon is afraid of becoming a &#8220;commodity connectivity provider,&#8221; aka a dump pipe, which is exactly what most of us wish it would be. <br /></p><p>For Verizon &#8212; and nearly every other large carrier or network provider &#8212; the way out of becoming what its customers actually want it to be is to become a content provider (see: Comcast).  <br /></p><p>Imagine a world in a which a network, already flush with profits, is happy providing bandwidth and letting hardware and software manufacturers do the rest. Dream a little dream.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-3774883050173751345?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
