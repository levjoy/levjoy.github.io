    The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/28/international/europe/28london.html">New York Times</a> and others today reported on the ABC News footage of bombs found in a car in Britain that had been used by the would-be London bombers last week.  

That footage showed three types of bombs that were found in the car's trunk, one of which looked like a milk container with nails studded around the side, and others that look kind of like steel-plated pancakes.

These last bombs don't really look like bombs or anything that scary.  So how did the Times contributors describe them?  "One image showed four bombs, three of them white objects that looked like wheels of Camembert." 

Camembert?  They look much more like brie or chevre to me.
