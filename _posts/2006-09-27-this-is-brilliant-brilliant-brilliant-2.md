I, like many people, have issues with Bill Clinton but can't help from loving him sometimes.  He's just such a good politician and so, so smart.  His performance on Fox the other day was inspiring.  If only the rest of the Democrats could take a hint.

Keith Olbermann responded to the incident the other night.  He pulled no punches and didn't talk like a guy from the "mainstream media" but rather like a passionate progressive who's had enough.  Take a look.
