<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/apple">Apple</a> just backtracked from the most controversial measure it took in its anti-Flash campaign: banning apps using third-party development tools.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-caves-apps-developed-with-third-party-tools-will-be-welcome-in-app-store-2010-9">businessinsider.com</a></div><br /><p>One of my biggest beefs with Apple in the last few months has been its revised development guideline, which restricted developers from using third-party tools to build iPhone apps.</p><br /><p>This meant that developers hoping to build apps for multiple platforms &#8212; Android and iPhone, for example &#8212; were left in cold; they&#8217;d have to write two or more completely separate apps, using different coding languages.</p><br /><p>Thankfully, Apple has revised those guidelines and lifted those restrictions. In addition to making it easer to develop for multiple mobile platforms, developers can also use Flash to develop apps (though there&#8217;s still no Flash on the iPhone or the iPad).</p><br /><p>One small win for openness.</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-7788078156054896037?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
