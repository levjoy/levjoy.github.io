    <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com">WorldChanging</a> has a great <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004539.html">discussion</a> today of organic vs. nonorganic and local vs. nonlocal food.
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The globalization of organic food is already well under way: at Whole Foods you can buy organic asparagus flown in from Argentina, raspberries from Mexico, grass-fed meat from New Zealand. In an era of energy scarcity, the purchase of such products does little to advance the ideal of sustainability that once upon a time animated the organic movement. These foods may contain no pesticides, but they are drenched in petroleum even so.</blockquote>
The history of the complex status of Whole Food and the legacy of corn in the American diet make it a pretty interesting read.
