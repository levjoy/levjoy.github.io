    Just posted this challenge for you to leave Facebook at <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/it-time-abandon-facebook">techPresident</a> (hello old friend!): 

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday a <a href="http://www.deannazandt.com/">friend of mine</a> suggested I start a petition to get a large group of people to commit to leaving Facebook. So I <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/leavefacebook">started one</a>. </p>

<p>The request didn’t come out of nowhere. This week, a few <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/facebook-deactivate-wave/">early adopter-types</a> — the kind of people who took up Facebook years before your mom did — decided they’d had enough of Facebook’s evolving terms of use and privacy issues and hit delete on their accounts (take a look at <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline">EFF's overview of Facebook's eroding privacy policy</a> for more). This might not yet qualify as a trend, but something’s definitely brewing among the techno-scenti. </p>

<p>The problem starts and ends with privacy. It seems that every few months, the itchy folks at Facebook launch yet another iteration of the site — er, <em>platform</em> — exposing even more of your private information to the world, and making it harder to keep your personal life close to your chest (or at least limit it to a few hundred friends). </p>
