Rosanne and I have decided to start a new group blog together, <a href="http://www.thelabpartners.com">the lab partners</a>.  The idea, hopefully, is to set a conversation topic and write about until our fingers run dry, then set another topic.

Here's Rosanne's version of how the blog started:
<blockquote>after talking to each other for a while through their own respective
“blogs,” one day josh IM’d rosanne and said “hey what do you think
about doing a group blog?” rosanne answered “souds fun, wht shoudl we
do?” (because rosanne never corrects typos and the n key on her
computer kind of sticks a little.) they hashed out a few ideas,
enlisted everyone they knew, and lo, a site was bor</blockquote>
Some friends will be joining us, though we're not sure exactly how many.  We'll be writing about all kinds of things; I'll mostly indulge my genocide fetish while Rosanne will show off her encyclopedic knowledge of celebrity fandom.
