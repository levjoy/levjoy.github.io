With the Samsung Galaxy Tab also available with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in addition to Verizon and Sprint, we are getting closer to a world where people can get the device they want, AND the carrier they want. All we need now is to get the smaller and rural carriers in the game on the same terms, and to extend the model to smartphones. Then we might see competition on price and quality of wireless service, and devices that compete to be more open and better platforms for speech, innovation, and democracy - it&#8217;s a good future, if only we can get there.</p><br /><p>[Note: I am still concerned about the price point, echoing the post below - I don&#8217;t know how well it will do in the market if only for that reason, though I do expect San Francisco and Manhattan users to be excited about using a data network not run by AT&amp;T. My ebullience is driven more by policy and precedent than by optimism as to the market success of this specific device at this price point.]</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-1106222823876856492?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
