<a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=211">Ethan Zuckerman</a> wrote a really good post today about his meet-up with a Georgie supporter.  Ethan's willingness, and desire, to get to know the "other side" is a quality I wish more so-called liberals have.  Too many of us are far too comfortable in our beliefs and spend more moralizing than actually wondering why other people think they things they do.  I applaud anyone who, like Rousseau [shameless plug for credibility] look into themselves critically and refused to succumb to the temptation to judge others.  

And the best part is, Ethan offers the definitive statement about whether or not Georgie is eViL:

<blockquote>
Ian asked me two difficult questions before we left. One was whether I, like some self-identified liberals he knew, thought George W. Bush was evil. I had to think about this for a little while. I dislike Bush profoundly. I think he’s incompetent, loyal to the point of cronyism, and surrounded by unethical political strategists and passionate ideologues. I think he’s wrong much of the time, and has a hard time admitting when he is wrong. I don’t think he’s evil. Which is to say, I don’t think his intent is to harm individuals or our nation. I think much of what he’s done has been destructive to the poor, to our military, to our international reputation and to the constitution. But I don’t think this damage was done out of malice. (Like I said, I had to think about this for a while.)</blockquote>

That about sums it up.  Debate over.  Not evil.
