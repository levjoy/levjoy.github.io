However much Sarah Palin's negative, negative, negative speech got under my skin, nothing was worse than the cynical display of her newborn son Trig.  Sullivan <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/parading-the-ba.html">says it best</a>: 

<blockquote>Did I just see Cindy holding Trig? I mean: can we have it one way or
the other? Either the family is out of bounds or it is in the
spotlight. Brandishing a Down Syndrome child as a campaign statement is
daring the press to ask questions about him. And if you are going to
hold the baby in front of the cameras, how can you say that the details
of his birth cannot even be discussed?

</blockquote>

I've been searching for the word to describe how this made me feel.  And it's "vulgar."  The use of Trig and the cynical pandering to middle America was just vulgar.
