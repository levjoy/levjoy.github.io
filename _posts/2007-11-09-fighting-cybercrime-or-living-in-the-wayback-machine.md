<p>Senators Pat Leahy, Arlen Specter, and Dick Durbin are co-sponsoring a new bill to help fight online identity theft, and yesterday they sent me an email about it. </p>

<p>The banner at the top of the email read: &#8220;Fighting Cybercrime.&#8221; </p>

<p>Listen, I hate identity theft as much as the next guy, but why must we call it &#8220;cybercrime?&#8221;  This isn't stuff out of a William Gibson novel, it&#8217;s an unofortunate part of our everyday lives.  </p>

<p>And what&#8217;s with the banner?  Yes, I get it, ones and zeroes equals &#8220;digital,&#8221; and &#8220;digital&#8221; equals &#8220;cyber.&#8221;  Passports equal identity, and Leahy and Durbin equal&#8230; cybercrime fighters.</p>

<p>Throw in a monotype computer font (cyber!) and &#8212; BAM &#8212; we&#8217;re back in 1996 all over again.  </p>

<p>It gets worse: somehow, someway, the designers found <em>another</em> monotype font to use, this one as bad as the first.   </p>

<p>Message to legislators: more and more aspects of our identities are stored online, and that information is in danger of being stolen.  It&#8217;s 2007; you can make this point perfectly clear without the aid of Bladerunner-esque phrases and imagery which, rather than paint you as cybercrime fighters of the future, actually make you look stuck in the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Wayback Machine</a>.  </p>
