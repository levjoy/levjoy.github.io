<p>I love this bit of sarcasm from Shepard Smith: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editor-in-chief of social media site Mashable.com, Lance Ulanoff, sat down with Smith to discuss AT&amp;T&#8217;s data service plan. &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing anything differently than I ever have, but now they&#8217;re going to charge me more for the same thing I&#8217;ve always been doing,&#8221; Smith said to Ulanoff. &#8220;Thanks, because you know what, you&#8217;re system is awesome. It really works great!&#8221; Smith jokingly said to AT&amp;T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s right. AT&amp;T (and Verizon and others) continue to get away with charging us more and more for the same services. </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it supposed to work the other way? Shouldn&#8217;t services get <em>cheaper </em>as more people use them and as technology improves? </p>
