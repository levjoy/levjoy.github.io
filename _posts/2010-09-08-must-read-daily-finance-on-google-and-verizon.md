<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">So, we now have the curious situation that while the Google-Verizon proposal doesn&#8217;t require net neutrality for wireless networks, Verizon Wireless is preparing to roll out 4G wireless service under open-access provisions &#8212; a service that will likely power millions of Google Android-equipped devices.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company-news/google-verizon-fcc-war-over-internets-future/19605776/">dailyfinance.com</a></div><br /><p>Sam Gustin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company-news/google-verizon-fcc-war-over-internets-future/19605776">backstory</a> on the Google-Verizon anti-Net Neutrality pact is one of the best I&#8217;ve read about the issue.</p><br /><p>There&#8217;s tons to dig through, but one bit about wireless stuck out.</p><br /><p>Back in 2008, Google and Verizon both bid for a bunch of wireless spectrum the FCC was auctioning off. Verizon won with a bid of $4.7 billion (Gustin says Google never really wanted the spectrum, just a guarantee of open access rules, which it got).</p><br /><p>Now, Verizon is preparing to roll out a 4G network that, thanks to its agreement with Verizon to dominate the mobile universe with <a href="http://openmobile.posterous.com/verizon-willingly-screws-up-another-phone">variously crippled or open Android phones</a>, would give Google access to a huge and fast new wireless network.</p><br /><p>It appears that the seeds of the Goorizen deal were planted in 2008. Scary.</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-7077829144104077059?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
