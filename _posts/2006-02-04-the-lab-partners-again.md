A few virtuous readers have pointed out that I didn't provide a link to my new group blog,<a href="http://www.thelabpartners.com"> the Lab Partners</a>, co-authored by the inimitable <a href="http://notmuch.blogsome.com%20">Rosanne</a> and others (possibly, at some point, my brother <a href="http:///www.levytheband.com">James</a> and my wife Nicole).  I'm busy boy these days, overextending myself to ensure that my head is constantly on the verge of exploding... poor me.  

Anyway, the link is above.  Please visit.
