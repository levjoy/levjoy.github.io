    <p>My buddy <a href="http://davidcolarusso.com/">David Colarusso</a> is a true renaissance man. He's a former high school science teacher, web developer (responsible for the <a href="http://10questions.com">10Questions</a> site), law student, and online politics afficionado.</p>
<p>Last year David's created <a href="http://communitycounts.us">Community Counts</a> to give regular YouTubin' folks the chance to participate in politics; it was subsequently used for the 10Questions presidential debate project. He has since developed a version of the site that can be used by any community to create forums using video, text, or images. It's a great piece of software, and I hope he finds endless ways to use it.</p>
<p>But for now, in response to a <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/08/06/the-debates-now-with-embeddable-video/">half-hearted attempt</a> by the Commission on Presidential Debates to use the interwebs for the debates, David is reviving last summer's project, asking regular folks like you and me to <a href="http://www.communitycounts.com/add/?id=us">submit</a> video or text questions on Community Counts and vote on your favorites. The ones that rise to the top will, in theory, be posed to Obama and McCain.</p>
<p>Here's David's introductory video explaining things:</p>
<p>And here's the first entry, which happens to be from, um, me:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Go ahead and post your own video and vote!</p>
