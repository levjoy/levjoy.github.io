[Wow, I couldn't spell <em>anything</em>]

Last year I started go to a <a href="http://russianandturkishbaths.com/">Turkish bath house</a> in the East Village about once a month.  It was so much fun: I would get totally overheated, jump in a freezing pool, rinse, and repeat.  People sometimes make made jokes about sexual behavior there, but I never say saw anything.

Now, there's <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182007/news/regionalnews/spa_sex_shock.htm">this</a>:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"> An ex-masseuse at the famed Russian and Turkish Baths says sexual high jinks at the East Village spa were too much for her to deal with - and she's a former call girl and dominatrix.

In a $100 million Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit, Susan Shellogg says she was "was strongly urged" by her bosses "to engage in sexual activity with clients," and was routinely exposed to male-on-female, female-on-female, male-on-male and solo sex acts - and that doesn't include the fetish porn she was told to watch.

"This was a terrible way to earn a living," said Shellogg's lawyer, Mark Lubelsky. "This goes beyond the bounds of decent civilized society."</blockquote>
I honestly had no idea.
