I love my del.cio.us links that get posted to my blog ever day (or every day that I bookmark something on del.icio.us).  It gives me the illusion that I'm actually posting to my blog.  I can tell myself that and I feel better.  But in actuality I post very little on here that is meant for this blog and this blog only.  The trials of a busy person.

Hang on for that updated about the thesis and its proposal.  I'll write about it, I swear, for no other reason than to clear my head of it.
