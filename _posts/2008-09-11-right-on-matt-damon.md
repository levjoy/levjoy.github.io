I love Matt Damon for his chameleon-like acting ability, his charming intelligence, and his perfect summary of why Sarah Palin scares the Wasilla out of me.&nbsp; <br /><br />"I need to know if she really thinks dinosaurs were here 4,000 years ago... I want to know that, I really do, because she's going to have the nuclear codes." <br /><br /><br /><div class="youtube-video"></div>
