<a href="http://desimediabitch.blogspot.com/2005/07/300-plus-dead-but-not-as-important-as.html">Chien(ne)s Sans Frontieres </a> has a good post today about yesterday's train crash in Pakistan, wondering why that accident, which killed almost six times as many people as last week's terrorist attacks in London, hasn't been covered as much as those attacks.  "I guess the country (Pakistan, that is) is not as glamorous as the UK and Pakistan could afford to lose 300+. But London's 37 are more important," she says.  This is similar to a question I asked the <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/2005/07/another-massacre-no-one-cares-about-2/">other day</a>.  Why is London getting <i>so</i> much more coverage than these other disasters?  Is it true that people think Western European lives are more important than African or Asian lives?
