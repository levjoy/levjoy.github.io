    Spurred on by Heidi's <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/03/19/thoughts-from-my-israel-trip-warning-rambling-ahead/#comment-23714">comment</a> on my <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/03/19/thoughts-from-my-israel-trip-warning-rambling-ahead/">Israel round-up post</a>, I've been increasingly interested in Jewish/Israeli writers -- mostly coming from the left -- that counter the with-us-or-against-us positions on Israel that you see so often in our newspapers and popular media.  All too often in the States, being friends with Israel means casting a blind eye toward the Palestinians and supporting every hard-line decision the Israelis make.

What I want is to soak up honest information, and I've been getting a good taste of it lately.

A writer going by the pseudonym of Jeremiah Haber wrote a <a href="http://themagneszionist.blogspot.com/2008/03/deep-rift-between-jim-bakers-texas.html">fascinating post</a> about the folks in George H. W. Bush's cabinet that worked for peace, including Dennis "Israel's Lawyer" Ross.

Haim Watzman, who writes, with Gershom Gorenberg, the <a href="http://southjerusalem.com/">South Jerusalem</a> blog, which has quickly become an invaluable guide to left-ish Israeli politics and culture.  This was the side of Israel I missed on my trip, so now I'm catching up.

<a href="http://micah.sifry.com">Micah Sifry</a> got me into all of this (he shared the Haber post in Google Reader today), so thanks to him. There's of course so much more out there -- I'm looking forward to discovering it.
