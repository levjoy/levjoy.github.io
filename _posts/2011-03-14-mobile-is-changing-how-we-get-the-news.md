<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"> <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Nearly half of all American adults (47%) report that they get at least some local news and information on their cellphone or tablet computer.</blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Local-mobile-news.aspx">pewinternet.org</a></div> <p>This fascinating new <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Local-mobile-news.aspx">study</a> from Pew Internet reports that a good slice of American adults get some form of local news from their mobile device.  </p><p>The majority of that news is weather and info about restaurants and businesses. General news is less popular.  </p><p>Also interesting: &#8220;while almost half of adults get local news on mobile devices, just 1 in 10 use apps to do so. Call it the &#8216;app gap.&#8217;&#8221; </p><p>Does this mean most users are just catching up with early adopters, or that mobile usage is still skewed toward the actual web rather than walled garden-like apps?</p></div></div>
