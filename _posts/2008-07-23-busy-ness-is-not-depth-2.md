    <p>When I first discovered the enormous mass of online information and social connections lying beneath the surface of my seemingly tranquil life, I got pretty obsessed with the internet. But it seemed like nothing I could do could get me to that far-off, ill-defined place in which I'd achieve informational nirvana: all of my feeds would be read, all of my social connections would be firmly in place, and my workflow would be blessedly frictionless.</p>
<p>Then I realized I was experiencing what millions of others experience: the modern curse of multitasking, skimming the virtual surface, distracting myself to death, etc, etc.</p>
<p>In the last few months -- neatly coinciding with the <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/05/25/yes-its-true-there-will-be-a-little-levy/">revelation</a> that in October the first of my offspring will enter this mortal coil -- I've worked hard to put those habits behind me. I want to dig deep again, whether it's reading an article online, connecting to friends on Facebook, writing posts like this one, or (gasp!) reading a novel. There's no reason advanced minds such as our own can't handle the crazy influx of information that whooshes in every day, every hour, every second.</p>
<p>But it looks like social trends are veering in a different direction. <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article4362950.ece">Writes</a> the Times Online's Bryan Appleyard (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One irony that lies behind all this is the myth that children are good at this stuff. Adults often joke that their 10-year-old has to fix the computer. But itâ€™s not true. Studies show older people are generally more adept with computers than younger. This is because, like all multitaskers, <strong>the kids are deluding themselves into thinking that busy-ness is depth <span style="font-weight:normal;">when</span></strong>, in fact, they are skimming the surface of cyberspace as surely as they are skimming the surface of life. It takes an adult imagination to discriminate, to make judgments; and those are the only skills that really matter.</p>

<p>"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked," Allen Ginsberg wrote way back when. I'm thinking the same thing, but instead of post-war hysteria and psychotropic drug use, I'm seeing Google Reader addiction.</p>
<p>(A disclaimer: I use Google Reader and I'm a big believer in online social networks. But I don't think the use of these things and a deeper intellectual life need to be mutually exclusive. Sue me.)</p>
