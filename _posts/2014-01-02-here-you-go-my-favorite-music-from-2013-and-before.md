<h2><strong>Albums</strong></h2>
In no particular order.

<strong>My Bloody Valentine, <em>mbv</em></strong>
It's like they never left. The first MBV album in 20 years is as good as the last one. And last third reaches new heights of noise, melody and rhythm.

<strong>Deerhunter, <em>Monomania
</em></strong>One of my favorite bands delivers yet another amazing record, blurring the lines between Deerhunter the band and Bradford Cox's own Atlas Sound/bedroom recordings/whatever garage-pop-ness.

<strong>Haim, <em>Days Are</em> Gone
</strong>At first I found this boring. Now I can't stop listening to it. Tight playing, great songwriting with dashes of Michael Jackson, Joni Mitchell, Belinda Carlisle and so much more.

<strong>Reputante, Oceanside
</strong>My brother releases another fine record.

<strong>The National, <em>Trouble Will Find</em> Me
</strong>My favorite National record, which is saying a lot.

<strong>M.I.A.,</strong> <em><strong>Matangi
</strong></em>To the haters: It's ok to write about a social trend ("Y.A.L.A") a year after it happens.

<strong>Eleanor Friedberger, <em>Personal Record
</em></strong>She teamed up with John Wesley Harding to write the best songs of her career. Sounds great too.

<strong>Yo La Tengo, <em>Fade
</em></strong>Back to basics, with some gorgeous songs that I usually need to save for rainy days.

<strong>Luke Temple, <em>Good Mood Fool
</em></strong>Temple fronts the fantastic Here We Go Magic. Here he goes electro-funk, which is fine with me.
<h2><strong>Tracks (2013)</strong></h2>
Rather than give entire albums honorable mention, I've highlighted single tracks from new albums. In all of these cases, I didn't really listen to the entire record; I just obsessed over a single track.

Destroyer, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-cTy6HwAYA">Babieca</a>"

Low, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfNLtUUEiGI">Plastic Cup</a>"

Many more obsessions from before 2013, all of which kept me going throughout the year.
