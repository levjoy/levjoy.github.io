<blockquote><p>Verizon Wireless today released the Motorola Xoom and flash-less of course. You can get for about $600….with a 2 year contract. Motorola, here’s a piece of advice; don’t trust Carriers! They will ruin sales for you by adding their 2 years contract and expensive prices for the tablet itself. Tablet is nothing like a smartphone which is something we need. Tablets are like the in between device and is mostly just for fun. </p></blockquote>
