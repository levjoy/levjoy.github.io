      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The ramifications of today’s <a href="http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/pdf/08-205.pdf">Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC</a> are breathtaking – opening the floodgates of political money such as we have never seen before.&nbsp; If you thought Congress was ‘for sale’ to the highest bidder, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of how our campaign finance laws is demanded as a result of today’s decision.</p>
<p>But one thing becomes immediately clear: Transparency about the flow of campaign cash – online and in real time – became more important. While we do not think that transparency is a panacea for the horrific consequences of today’s decision, it is critically important as the shredded system is rebuilt.</p></blockquote>

    <p>The Citizen's United decision is awful news. It will allow corporate cash to flood into politics like never before.
