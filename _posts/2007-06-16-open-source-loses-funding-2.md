<a href="http://www.socialmedia.biz/2007/06/wgbh_pulls_plug.html">This</a> is really terrible.  Although I don't listen to its podcasts as much as I should, I love <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">Open Source Radio</a>, and now it's lost its funding from WGBH in Boston.

Marty Lucas and I stopped by their studios about a year and half ago to do some filming, and they were really welcoming as they showed us the ins and outs of producing a smart, innovative, and fun radio show that took the open-source ethic of the web to a new level.

The show is a gem.  Let's hope they find a different source of funding.  And check out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/06/digging_deepercollaborative_ra.html">this great piece</a> from MediaShift about the show and ways that radio can collaborate with its audience more deeply and meaningfully via the web.
