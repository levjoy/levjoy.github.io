    I recently worked on a film called "<a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/future/m2m.mov">Many to Many</a>" with a teacher of mine, Marty Lucas.  It was commissioned by the <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/">Center for Social Media</a> at American University and takes a look at the necessary relationship between public media and the blogosphere.  A lot of the <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org">Global Voices </a>folks are featured in it, as is Christopher Lydon and Brendan Greeley from the <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org">Open Source</a> radio show.  Brendan recently wrote a nice note about the film <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/filmed-in-the-os-studio/">here</a>.
