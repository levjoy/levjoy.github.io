There's been a lot of activity on my graduate program's listserv about the continuing destruction of Lebanon.  It's been getting a little heated and personal -- I'm as guilty as anyone else.  As I mentioned in an email to the list, I don't think it's appropriate to use the school's communication tool for a political argument in which people may get offended and accusations begin to fly.  Let's use my blog instead!  So if anyone shows up here from that list, I welcome your comments here, where we can continue the conversation.  If it doesn't happen, I guess that means blogs really <em>aren't </em>they best method of communication this time.
