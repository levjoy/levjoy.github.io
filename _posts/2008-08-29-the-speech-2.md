    It's funny that some pundits -- including those who criticize Obama for being too lofty and rhetorical -- are criticizing this speech for being too red-meat, not inspiring enough. <p />It inspired me.  From start to finish, it ebbed and flowed, Obama would rise up and get righteously angry and then shrink back down to earth, only to crescendo again.  <p />And he attacked, and made a case for good government.  Some folks are comparing Obama to Lincoln and to Kennedy.  Those comparisons are apt, but I'm seeing a 21st-century FDR -- a man uniquely suited to our times. <br /><a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/08/the-hope-we-con.html"><br />Andrew Sullivan</a>: <p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Above all, he took on national security - face on, full-throttle, enraged, as we should all be, at how disastrously American power has been handled these past eight years. He owned this issue in a way that no Democrat has owned it since Kennedy. That's a transformative event.<br />
</blockquote><p />I've heard about change a lot this year, but this was the first time I truly saw what we are on the brink of -- a true break from the past but a reclaiming of everything that could and should be good about this country.
