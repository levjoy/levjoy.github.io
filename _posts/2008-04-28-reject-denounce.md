Last Friday I was suddenly inspired to create a new web site.  It would be almost the same as <a href="http://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/">barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com</a> except that it would ask the public to Reject and Denounce things (recall that Barack Obama was asked to do the same about Jeremiah Wright in a debate with Hillary Clinton).
<br><br>
I pinged my buddy<a href="http://jedsundwall.com/"> Jed Sundwall</a> about it, hoping he could help me find a developer to do a quick and dirty install.  He did -- tapping a wonderful resource in the discussion board at <a href="http://pevz.org/works/">pevz.org/works</a> -- and by Friday night, <a href="http://rejectanddenounce.org/">rejectanddenounce.org</a> was born.   Here's an example of the zaniness:

So check out the site, and post your rejections/denunciations!
