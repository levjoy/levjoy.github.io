<p>Now that the death toll in Myanmar is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/world/international-myanmar-cyclone.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">nearing 100,000</a>, one wonders if military intervention -- with the express reason of getting food and medicine to the Burmese people, and fast -- is a solution. I'm not an anti-interventionist. Like <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2008/05/is-there-an-exa.html">George Packer</a>, I think that one tragedy of Iraq is that it's ensured that the U.S. can't perform humanitarian interventions without its moral intentions every being questions.</p>
<p>Not that it ever performed many purely humanitarian interventions.<br /></p>
<p>But that's beside the point. Should we risk a fight with the Burmese military, potentially bog ourselves down, and risk infamy in the eyes of the world? Packer says <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2008/05/is-there-an-exa.html">maybe</a>. I'm thinking that if it saves 100,000 lives, there's no question what we should do.</p>
