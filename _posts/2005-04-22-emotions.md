    Showing my work-in-progress footage to my class is exhausting.  I don't know why but I feel so spent after showing sections I've worked on recently for the pigeon film.  I think part of it has to do with my my perception of my classmates' and teacher's opinions.  That is, my constant worrying about whether they liked the footage or not, or if their opinion of me as filmmaker has gone up or down since I've shown them the footage.  The whole point of critiques is that we learn from them and benefit from the opinions of others.  If they just said they liked the footage, or said nothing, they'd be of no help at all.  Yet there I am, totally a mess and feeling like I've exposed myself in public.
