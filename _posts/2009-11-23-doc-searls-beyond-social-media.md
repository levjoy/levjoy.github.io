      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Missing in action is credit to what goes below private platforms like Twitter, MySpace and Facebook — namely the Net, the Web, and the growing portfolio of standards that comprise the deep infrastructure, the geology, that makes social media (and everything else they support) possible. </p>
<p>Look at four other social things you can do on the Net (along with the standards and protocols that support them): email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, MIME); blogging (HTTP, XML, RSS, Atom); podcasting (RSS); and instant messaging (IRC, XMPP, SIP/SIMPLE). Unlike private social media platforms, these are NEA: Nobody owns them, Everybody can use them and Anybody can improve them. That’s what makes them <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/understanding-infrastructure">infrastructural</a> and <a>generative</a>.  (Even in cases where protocols were owned, such as by <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> with <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/05/21/podcastingAndRssAtBerkman.html">efforts were made</a> to remove ownership as an issue.)</p></blockquote>

    <p>Missed this until now. Wonderful discussion of the "social media" misnomer, and the problems of having private platforms -- as opposed to open, public platforms like email, blogging and IM -- dominate the web.</p></div>
