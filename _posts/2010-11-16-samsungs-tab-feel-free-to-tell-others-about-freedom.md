<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><p>Samsung&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/samsungmobileusa#">promotion of the Galaxy Tab</a> has strapped on its water skis, dispensed with the life jacket, revved up the engines of its Android-powered motor boat, and jumped &#8212; no, leaped &#8212; over a massive shark.</p><br /><p>The conceit? &#8220;Feel free to tell us what freedom means to you in two minutes or less.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Put aside the strange, confusing wording for a minute. Just what the heck does an Android have to do with freedom?</p><br /><p>&#8220;With the Samsung Galaxy Tab, you&#8217;ll feel free to video chat, use Adobe Flash technology and be truly mobile.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Right. Got it.</p><br /><p>And wait &#8212; they&#8217;re not finished with the freedom yet:</p><br /><p>&#8220;So feel free to enter, and feel free to tell others what freedom means to you.&#8221;</p><br /><p>Got it? Samsung Tab = Free. Except it costs $600. Unless you make a video about how free it makes you feel. Then you might be one of the lucky 100 winners of a free Samsung Freedom Tab.</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-1847107548657824254?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
