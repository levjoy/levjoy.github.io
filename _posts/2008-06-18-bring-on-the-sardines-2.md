    <p>I worked out of the PdF office today (one week to go 'til <a href="http://pdf2008.confabb.com/">PdF 2008!</a>), and for lunch <a href="http://thatcrazyrapmusic.blogspot.com/">Josh Sherman</a> and I went to a Vietnamese sandwich place on Grand St. He got a traditional Vietnamese pork sandwich, and I picked up three enormous fresh spring rolls.</p>
<p>But the highlight of the trip was the bowl of peanuts and anchovies we purchased on a lark.<p />

I'd never had the dish before -- didn't even know it existed -- but I was pleasantly surprised. The fishy saltiness (or is that salty fishiness?) of the anchovies mingled nicely with the peanuts, and it was all complemented by a slightly spicy chili sauce. I found it pretty addictive, but others in the office stayed away, perhaps intimidated by the anchovy heads swimming among the peanuts in the plastic bowl.</p>
<p>I felt like I'd made a good culinary choice, though, especially since I've been obsessed with eating small fish like anchovies and sardines, egged on by <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/06/on-giving-up-salmon-for-sardines.php">increased warnings</a> about the safety and sustainability of both farmed and wild big fish like salmon and tuna.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/04/29/bottomfeeder/index.html">Turns out</a> sardines and other small fish occupying the lower echelons of the oceanic food chain are super high in Omega-3 fatty acids, contain very low levels of mercury, and aren't in danger of becoming extinct. Maybe it's time to start a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardine_diet">sardine diet</a>.</p>
