<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote><br /><div><br /><h3><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:13px;">As I show in <em>Internet Architecture and Innovation</em>, the Internet’s original architecture had two components that jointly created an economic environment that fostered application innovation:</span></h3><br /><p style="padding-left:30px;">1. A network that was able to support a wide variety of current and future applications (in particular, a network that did not need to be changed to allow a new application to run) and that did not allow network providers to discriminate among applications or classes of applications. As I show in the book, using the broad version of the end-to-end arguments (i.e., the design principle that was used to create the Internet’s original architecture) <a href="http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/09/future-of-the-internet-symposium-generative-end-hosts-vs-generative-networks.html#footnote%201">[1]</a> <a name="text%20footnote%201"></a>to design the architecture of a network creates a network with these characteristics.</p><br /><p style="padding-left:30px;">2. A sufficient number of general-purpose end hosts <a href="http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/09/future-of-the-internet-symposium-generative-end-hosts-vs-generative-networks.html#footnote%202">[2]</a> <a name="text%20footnote%202"></a>that allowed their users to install and run any application they like.</p><br /><p>Both are essential components of the architecture that has allowed the Internet to be what Zittrain calls “generative” – “to produce unanticipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences.”</p><br /><p>via <a href="http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2010/09/future-of-the-internet-symposium-generative-end-hosts-vs-generative-networks.html">concurringopinions.com</a></p><br /></div><br /></blockquote><br /><p>Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick has written a blog post (as part of a series on Concurring Opinions inspired by Jonathan Zittrain&#8217;s book &#8216;The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It&#8217;) on the distinctions between devices and networks in considering the openness of the Internet.  [Professor Zittrain&#8217;s concept of &#8216;generativity&#8217; identifies one of the key aspects of what any Internet policy advocate cares about when talking about &#8216;open&#8217; - the ability of the Internet to encourage innovation and new uses, by everyone, not just the network operators.]  These distinctions are particularly salient in the mobile world, because that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re seeing the rush of closed devices that concerns JZ - the iPad and the iPhone are brand new worlds of consumer-friendly yet largely non-generative consumption platforms.</p><br /><p>Professor van Schewick&#8217;s post serves as a reminder to the iPad-obsessed crowd that we need an open and generative network, and we&#8217;re in real danger of losing the one we&#8217;ve got, especially in wireless.  We can&#8217;t afford to let wireless slip by the wayside of open network policy, and we can&#8217;t afford to let 4G networks be built around prioritized IMS channels for certain preferred Internet traffic.</p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-955233940498997538?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
