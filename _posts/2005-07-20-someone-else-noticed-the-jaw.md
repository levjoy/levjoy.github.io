<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/harry-shearer/the-president-goes-jawggi_4456.html">Harry Shearer</a> at the Huffington Post (I wish I could say something like "Derek Smalls at Spinal Tap") also noticed Georgie's new jaw movements last night:
<p>
"During the announcement remarks, George W. Bush unveiled a (to me, at least) entirely new facial movement, and it was a trimphant debut, since the movement/tic/signal was repeated more than a dozen times. I have no idea what it means, but a new Presidential facial movement, well into the second term, is exciting enough on its own terms."

I'm glad Nicole and I weren't suffering from a group hallucination&#151;or maybe that's what was happening to Georgie?
