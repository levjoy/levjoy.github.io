<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,68938,00.html">Wired </a> is reporting that a new site, <a href="http://www.johntabin.com/neverpayretail/">Never Pay Retail</a>, is collecting online versions of subscription-only editorial content from the New York Times, which for now gets around the need to pay for my genocide coverage.  How am I supposed to keep tabs on Darfur without my Kristof?  I can keep reading one of my favorite bloggers, <a href="http://sleeplessinsudan.blogspot.com/">Humanitarian Hijinks</a>, but while she's completely informative and necessary, her experience as a relief worker in Sudan doesn't provide the kind of political context that Kristof does.  

After navigating to Never Pay Retail, I was able to go to the<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/"> Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a> (I always knew that paper existed but never actually read it before) to read Kristof's latest column on Pervez Musharraf's disgusting <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/241485_kristof21.html">blame-the-victim</a> crap concerning a rape epidemic in Pakistan.   

I'll also miss those great multi-media packages Kristof and his online producers put together, in which Kristof records commentary over photos and videos that for me are the most powerful statements against the genocide in Darfur.  Maybe the Grey Lady won't charge for those features, which are of course only available online, but I doubt it since they're even charging for a video called <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2005/09/16/business/20050919_MORGENSON_FEATURE.html&amp;OP=3517ccd1Q2F)xQ27K)Z9@iiZ)EQ5CNVQ5CQ22Q279)VQ51ZPY)WQ5EQ5EQ23)Q5El)Q2BQ60)Kq9Q3EAQ2799)WQ5EQ5EQ23Q5ElQ2BlOQ3CgQ5B0Q3AkJgkOCQ3AQ7Eo(Q5BQ3AnQ51ZPY">"Meet Gretchen Morgenson,"</a> which I'm guessing is a riveting intro to their new business writer.  I wouldn't know, since it's subscription only. 

<strong>UPDATE:</strong>  <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/09/22/tms_slct.html">Jay Rosen</a> wrote a fascinating article about the new TimesSelect deal and places it in the context of the Times laying off 500 workers this week.  He too sees a problem with losing "Nicholas Kristof's brand of human rights journalism" to this idiocy:

<blockquote>
Nick Kristof’s brand of human rights journalism, which depends on the mobilization of outrage, is simply less potent if it can’t reach widely around the world, and pass by every door. </blockquote>

Rosen also reminds us that a Thomas Friedman op-ed piece about democracy in Egypt will be read in Egypt by Egyptian, something that will surely cease now that they'll have to fork over "the equivalent to buying a few martinis" a year to read about their country.
