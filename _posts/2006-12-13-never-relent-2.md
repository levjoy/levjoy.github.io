Nicole and I were in Northampton over Thanksgiving.  We stopped into a record store to browse and stumbled upon a box full of cassettes that cost 25 cents to a dollar each, and we had to indulge.  We left with $3.50 worth of old tapes that we've been playing in the Volvo for the last few weeks.  Among our selections, most of which were released in the late '80s:
</p><p>
- Metallica, <em>...And Justice for All
<br /></em>Still amazing, despite the super-condensed guitars, drums that sound like tapping my fingers on a desk, and the utter lack of a bass.
</p><p>
- Pantera, <em>Vulgar Display of Power
<br /></em>R.I.P. Dimebag.
</p><p>
- Kate Bush, <em>The Sensual World
<br /></em>Includes an ode to her computer.
</p><p>
- Cypress Hill, <em>Cypress Hill
<br /></em>Sen Dog always sounds constipated.
</p><p>
- R.E.M., <em>Document
<br /></em>Yet another treasure.  I think "Welcome to the Occupation" is about Guatemala, or something.
</p><p>
- Robbie Robertson, <em>Robbie Robertson
<br /></em>The guy can't sing but he's written some of my favorite songs with The Band.  Daniel Lanois produced this record and U2 backed some of it up; "Showdown at Big Sky" and "Sweet Fire of Love" sound like awesome U2 songs with a bad singer.
</p><p>
Then I found a few more of my old tapes -- including an old fave, <em>The End of Silence </em>by the Rollins Band.  I <em>loved </em>that album and still know every word.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, a decade and a half later I've realized that the album is very, very bad.  Especially the lyrics.  It's total therapy rock.
</p><p>
But I've always admired Rollins for his honesty and intensity though he completely deficient in the subtlety department.
</p><p>
So... check out this rant.  It's amazing.  He's right, of course, and as always he's intense.
