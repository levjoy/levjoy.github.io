This year, "shitshow" became the new "douchebag." The word refers to moments when the shit entirely hits the fan, and chaos becomes so enveloping that we throw up our hands, shrug our shoulders, and move on.

Now it's time for a new meme champion: "fail."  Starting with <a href="http://failblog.org/">Failblog</a>, the notion of a "fail" -- of someone trying to do something right, but horribly failing at it -- has taken off.  And now comes the ultimate fail with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30bailout.html?hp"> failure of Congress to vote for a bailout plan</a>.

With the word "fail" appearing in countless headlines and articles about the plan, the meme has leapt from an artifact of webby playfulness to a true descriptor of our current financial shitshow.  What goes around comes around.
