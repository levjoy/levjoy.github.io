      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><h3>Enough</h3>

<p>Sometimes, I forget to eat lunch. So, 3:30 arrives, and I attack an infant-sized hillock of greasy takeout. I inhale it, scarcely breathing, a condemned man with minutes ‘til&nbsp;dawn.</p>

<p>Two minutes after stopping, <em>yes</em>; I feel like I’m going to die. Filled with regret and shrimp-induced torpor, I groan the empty promise of the glutton: “<em>never again</em>.”</p>

<p>What happened? How’d I miss when I’d had <strong><em>enough</em></strong>?</p>

<p>I wonder the same thing about folks who check for new email every 5 minutes, follow 5,000 people on Twitter, or try to <em>do</em> anything sane with 500 <span class="caps">RSS</span>&nbsp;feeds.</p>

<p>Some graze unlimited bowls of information by choice. Others claim it’s a necessity of remaining employed, landing sales, or “staying in the loop.” Could be. What about&nbsp;you?</p>

<p><strong>How do <em>you</em> know when <em>you’ve</em> had&nbsp;“enough?”</strong></p>

<p>Not everything, all the time, completely, forever. Just <em>enough</em>. Enough to start, ﬁnish, or simply&nbsp;maintain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, foodbabies only appear after it’s too late. And, if your satiety’s gauged solely by whether the buffet’s still open, you’re screwed. Like the hypothalamus-damaged rat, you’ll eat until you&nbsp;die.</p>

<p>Before the next buffet trip, consider asking, “How do I know <strong>what</strong> I need to know — <em>just for now</em>?”</p>

<p>Then savor every&nbsp;bite.</p></blockquote>
