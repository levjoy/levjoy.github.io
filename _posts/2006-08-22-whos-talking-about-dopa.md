While much of the mainstream media was preoccupied with wars in the Middle East, child molesters, and whatever else flits across our screens, Congress recently decided to play to peoples' fears and passed, almost unnoticed, a bill banning social networking sites from our schools.  The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.5319:">Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006</a>, or DOPA, requires that all public schools outlaw the use of social networking web sites and chat rooms in order to receive federal funds for technology.

The bill would force libraries to filter out any site that asks users to create identities.  That means sites like MySpace, Amazon.com and Blogger, and even the use of wikis and RSS, would be banned.  All of these technologies are being used in classrooms around the country as teachers develop new curricula and pedagogy that incorporate the read/write web; this bill could put an immediate end to their work.  Also, many poorer students depend upon public and school libraries to use the web.  This legislation would effectively throw them offline.  Many of us are excited about how these kinds of sites can be forums of civic participation, but DOPA would make it impossible for us to reach out to students and teach them about how to interact with online communities.

There is hope.  While 96%  of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- voted for DOPA in an effort to prove they are tough on child molesters, it still needs to pass through the Senate, so there is still time to talk to your senators and ask them not to vote for it.  Many people in Congress and the Senate simply have no idea what a social networking site is, or how it might be used for education, civic participation, or political organizing.  Before they vote we need to tell our Senators why these things are so important.

For many, blogging is not only about writing but also about the ways that people can communicate and learn from each other, regardless of the subject.  After <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2006/why-dopa-is-dopey-example-4592/">noting</a> that Lebanese and Israeli bloggers had initiated online conversations in the wake of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, Will Richardson, who blogs about education and technology at <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/">Weblogg-ed</a>, was saddened that, if DOPA is passed in the Senate, students will not have access to these kinds of conversations:
<blockquote>Sure, we can discuss the story. But fuggedabout actually showing the conversation to our kids or having them reflect on it on their own blogs where other people might be able to inform their thinking and learning. God forbid we forget to actually teach them how to stay safe from those Mid Eastern predators out there.</blockquote>
Richardson sees the passing of the bill as an easy way for Congress to convince the public they are tough on crime:
<blockquote>It’s nothing more than an attempt to damn the technology instead of engaging the tensions of a globalized world. We don’t want to do the tough work of understanding what the changes mean, good or bad. We just want to resist.</blockquote>
The American Library Association was opposed to DOPA from the beginning.  On his PBS blog <a href="http://www.pbs.org/teachersource/learning.now/2006/07/dopa_passes_the_house.html">learning.now</a>, Andy Carvin quotes American Library Association president Leslie Berger:
<p style="text-indent:20pt;">This unnecessary and overly broad legislation will hinder students’ ability to engage in distance learning and block library computer users from accessing a wide array of essential Internet applications including instant messaging, email, wikis and blogs.</p>
However, there are some dissidents in Congress.  After DOPA passed, Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat from Washington, <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=109-h20060726-41#sMonoElementm22m0m0m">said</a> the bill is "a good press release, but it is not effective legislation addressing a huge problem threatening our children."  Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat, also<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=109-h20060726-41#sMonoElementm10m0m0m"> stood up</a> to the fearmongering:  "This bill will not delete online predators. Rather, it will delete legitimate Web content from schools and libraries. Schools and libraries that serve students are the target of this legislation."

Back in May, before the bill was passed in the Congress, <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/">Danah Boyd</a> <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2006/05/11/antisocial_netw.html">summed </a>up the problems with the bill:
<blockquote>There are so many amazing things that teens do with social technologies. To lose all of this because of the culture of fear is terrifying to me. I found out about my alma mater talking to strangers online in the 90s. I learned about what it means to be queer, how to have confidence in myself and had so many engaging conversations. Sure, i found some sketchy people too, but i learned to ignore them just as i learned to ignore the guys who whistled and honked from their cars when i walked to the movie theater with my best friend. We need to give youth the knowledge to know the risks of their actions, the structures to be able to come to us when something goes wrong and the opportunity to grow up and connect to their peers. Eliminating cultural artifacts because we don't understand them does not make our lives any safer, but it does obliterate so many positive interactions.</blockquote>
This legislation would effectively block teens and educators from accessing some the most important parts of the web -- widening the digital divide.   It's now up to Richardson and others to convince the Senate of the usefulness of social software before it's too late.  Vermont Senator <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> has acted to slow things down in order to look more closely at the bill; hopefully he will inspire his colleagues to learn more about this bill before it's too late.
