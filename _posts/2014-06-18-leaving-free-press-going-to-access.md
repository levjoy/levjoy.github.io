Next week is my last week at <a href="http://www.freepress.net">Free Press</a> — I'm leaving to become Advocacy Director at <a href="http://www.accessnow.org">Access</a>.

I've had the great privilege of working with Free Press for five years on campaigns to protect Net Neutrality, stop mass surveillance and build more diverse media. I'm proud of the work we've done and I look forward to seeing even bigger wins in the future.

I'm excited to fight for our digital rights with yet another amazing organization. Access is working on the frontlines of many things I care about deeply — stopping mass surveillance, protecting Net Neutrality, and helping at-risk activists make their communications more secure. And it does it all via campaigning, policy work, research, tech expertise, and more. The fact that Access does this work on a global level is super important to me — we launched the <a href="http://www.webwewant.org">Web We Want</a> campaign last year to get more involved in the fight to protect digital rights around the world.

This is an amazing time to be working on these issues. I'm grateful that I'll continue to do so in this new role.
