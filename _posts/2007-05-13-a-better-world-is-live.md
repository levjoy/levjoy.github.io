I know what you've been thinking: can I get <em>more </em> link posts from Josh?  No really, I'm sure you've been wondering where I've been.  Or maybe you haven't.  It's true that I've been neglecting this blog in favor of <a href="http://www.techpresident.com">other</a>, more <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">profitable</a> blogs, and because my extracurricular work has been my thesis project for the last six months.  

Well, that work is finally coming to a close, and I'm happy to say that I have some videos for you to watch.  Over at my <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/betterworld">alter-ego/thesis blog</a> I've posted all five (5) chapters of my machinima documentary about social and political activism in Second Life, and built up a site around them to boot.  A lot of labor and love when into this project, including fine musical composition from my buddy Darren Clarke.  I do suggest you check them out, and drop me a line if you want.  

I'll be around sooner than later.  Promise.
