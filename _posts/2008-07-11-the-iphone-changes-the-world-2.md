    <p>I just posted a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-levy/the-iphone-changes-the-wo_b_112127.html">bit of a rant</a> at the Huffington Post. It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-family:Georgia;line-height:20px;">I can be a pain in the butt when it comes to Apple naysaying, and I could be accused of being an iPhone-owning, Macbook-tapping, iTunes-downloading hypocrite, but every time Apple launches a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" style="border-color:initial;text-decoration:none;color:#E43300;border-style:none;margin:0;padding:0;">marketing blitz</a> we endure an exhausting parade of claims that the new product will "change the world." There's no doubt that the new iPhone and, more importantly, the 2.0 software update, is very, very cool, and it does represent an evolution in mobile computing. But I'm confused about why so many of my fellow geeks find it necessary to describe this new product in terms typically reserved for advocacy campaigns or political slogans.</span><br /></p>
