People keep dying there, apparently, and these stories keep showing up.  CNN attributes it to "tensions" between the government and protesters.  I don't think it's possible to get more abstract and unspecific as that.  Maybe if we start talking about Kylie Minogue's breast cancer we can brings down to earth again.

Where is Uzbekistan, Canada?  

It's true, though, that ever since we got the tragic news about Kylie I've had the song "Can't Get You Out of my Head" running through my brain.
