I've always tried to bring friends from disparate places together. I've thrown nervous parties in which I've spied a friend working in city government chatting with a folk singer, or an introverted coder making small talk with a drunkard architect.  I liked the clash of personalities those parties encouraged, but I would get so anxious about everyone getting along I couldn't have much fun.

So why not try the same thing, but in web form?  That's the idea behind <a href="http://www.tag-themagazine.com">Tag</a>, the new project my good friend <a href="http://www.nancyscola.com">Nancy Scola</a> and I are soft-launching this week. 

The idea is simple: we're asking our friends and acquaintances to contribute essays, photos, videos, interviews, or any other kind of online-friendly media that draw out connections between diverse ideas, people, and things.  (One friend has already suggested an article about Papa Smurf and the official seal of Argentina...) 

Go <a href="http://www.tag-themagazine.com/">here</a> if you want to find out more and contribute.  We understand that the parameters are somewhat broad, but we're hoping you can suggest ideas -- like reviewing pancakes, or interviewing your favorite dirt farmer, or documenting how a web evangelist became a taxi driver  -- that are sometimes wacky, sometimes serious, but always culturally interesting.   Email us at editors@tag-themagazine.com with comments.
