    Ricardo, a student in my program, sent around a link to his friend <a href="http://mazenkerblog.blogspot.com/">Mazen Kerbaj's blog</a> on which he posts drawings documenting his experience of the war in Lebanon. They're sometimes funny and sometimes sad, but always an amazing look into one person's experience of this tragedy.
He also posts the images and words on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/72795424@N00/">Flickr.</a>
