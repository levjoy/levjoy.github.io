      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC website</a> was launched in June 1995 and redesigned in June 1999. The most recent&nbsp; redesign, initiated in March 2000 and completed in September 2001, achieved a common look-and-feel across all static pages of the site by introducing a standard agency-wide template supported internally by a style guide, design standards, posting policies and other web resources.</blockquote>

    <p>The FCC has done a nice job of redesigning a portion of its site, modeling a new design for the rest. One (un)surprising detail: The last redesign was completed in September 2001!</p></div>
