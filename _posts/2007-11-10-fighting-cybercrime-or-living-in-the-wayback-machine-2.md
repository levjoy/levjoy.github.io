    <p>Senators Pat Leahy, Arlen Specter, and Dick Durbin are co-sponsoring a new bill to help fight online identity theft, and yesterday they sent me an email about it. </p>

<p>The banner at the top of the email read: “Fighting Cybercrime.” </p>

<p>Listen, I hate identity theft as much as the next guy, but why must we call it “cybercrime?”  This isn't stuff out of a William Gibson novel, it’s an unofortunate part of our everyday lives.  </p>

<p>And what’s with the banner?  Yes, I get it, ones and zeroes equals “digital,” and “digital” equals “cyber.”  Passports equal identity, and Leahy and Durbin equal… cybercrime fighters.</p>

<p>Throw in a monotype computer font (cyber!) and — BAM — we’re back in 1996 all over again.  </p>

<p>It gets worse: somehow, someway, the designers found <em>another</em> monotype font to use, this one as bad as the first.   </p>

<p>Message to legislators: more and more aspects of our identities are stored online, and that information is in danger of being stolen.  It’s 2007; you can make this point perfectly clear without the aid of Bladerunner-esque phrases and imagery which, rather than paint you as cybercrime fighters of the future, actually make you look stuck in the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Wayback Machine</a>.  </p>
