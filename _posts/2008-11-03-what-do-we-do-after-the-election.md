Organize even more, says I on the Blog for Change: 

<blockquote>So many activists and journalists are overloading on the election right now (the Politico's Ben Smith says the election is "so metabolic at this point I'm not sure I can really unplug") that we don't know how we'll cope after Tuesday, when the constant adrenaline rush of polls and politics comes to an abrupt end.

Indeed, some people are anxiously anticipating a come-down as hardcore as that from a strong narcotic. After months -- more than 21 of them! -- of being bystanders, we'll get a shot at participating. But after that, we're gonna have to find something else to fill up the activist void, lest it be filled with candy and videogames.

It's an anxious thought, that all of this energy and enthusiasm that's been building up for that last two years will quickly blow its top like an electoral geyser, and then -- poof! -- we'll sit around lonely and dejected until the next tsunami of political stimulus smacks us in the face.

But in addition to filling the country with a new sense of hope and optimism in some seriously dark times, the Obama campaign injected new terminology into the vernacular of young America: the notion of something called "organizing." Before this election, how often had you heard college-age students talking about "organizing" as if it were a new emo band or a video game?

Regardless of who they actually voted for, a new generation has seen, through the Obama campaign, what happens when you unite a huge amount of people around a single cause. Even those that didn't support it saw the campaign as the embodiment of community organizing, and it created a movement much bigger than the administration of a tiny Alaskan town (sorry, Sarah Palin). Those of us that were born after the civil rights era had never seen anything like it.</blockquote>
