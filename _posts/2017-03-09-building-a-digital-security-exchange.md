I <a href="https://medium.com/@levjoy/building-a-digital-security-exchange-d392ad2f4982#.5noxdp4rx">just posted</a> a description of the Digital Security Exchange (DSX), an effort to connect vulnerable communities to digital security experts and trainers, to Medium. Here's a snippet:
<blockquote>Faced with the reality of a Trump presidency, U.S. organizations big and small have realized they’re at risk of being hacked, surveilled, trolled, and otherwise attacked online — risks that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/europe/wikileaks-cia-hacking.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this week’s WikiLeaks dump</a> detailing the CIA’s hacking abilities have driven home. So much infrastructure is vulnerable: Vast databases of constituent information sit in the cloud, state surveillance is eradicating privacy and chilling free speech, and the devices we depend on to communicate have been weaponized against us.
<p id="fdca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, existing recommendations can be dizzying. For many users, blog posts on how to install Signal, massive guides to protecting your digital privacy, and broad statements like “use Tor” — all offered in good faith and with the best of intentions — can be hard to understand or act upon. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If we want to truly secure civil society from digital attacks and empower communities in their to fight to protect their rights, we’ve got to recognize that digital security is largely a human problem, not a technical one. </strong>Taking cues from the experiences of the deeply knowledgeable global digital security training community, the Digital Security Exchange will seek to make it easier for trainers and experts to connect directly to the communities in the U.S. — sharing expertise, documentation, and best practices — in order to increase capacity and security across the board.</p>
