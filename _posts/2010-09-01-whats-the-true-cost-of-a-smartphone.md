<p>How much does your iPhone or Droid <em>really</em> cost? We don&#8217;t know, because the carriers won&#8217;t tell us. </p><br /><p>CNNMoney <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/01/technology/smartphone_price/">pretends</a> to delve into the details behind the $199 price point behind most smartphones. Writer David Goldman gives lots of reasons why unsubsidized prices are so much higher &#8212; like $599 for an unsubsidized iPhone &#8212; and he takes folks like AT&amp;T at their word when they explain why these phones cost so much:</p><br /><blockquote><br /><p><span style="font-family:Arial;line-height:20px;">Phones that tend to eat up more bandwidth &#8212; hello iPhone! &#8212; add to the carrier&#8217;s overhead. Put together the upfront cost of the phone and the back-end cost to service it, and you&#8217;re left with the phone&#8217;s profit margin. For a model with really tight margins, the carrier might find itself essentially forced to charge more upfront than it otherwise would &#8212; it can&#8217;t discount the purchase price and still scrape out a profit. That sometimes leads to inferior phones, like the BlackBerry Bold, carrying the same price tag as more advanced rivals, like <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/08/03/blackberry-torch-the-palm-preberry/">BlackBerry&#8217;s Torch</a>.</span> </p><br /></blockquote><br /><p>But while it&#8217;s true that we pay less than the full cost of these phones, we have no idea what that full cost actually is, because the carriers keep it secret. </p><br /><p>We&#8217;re locked into 2-year contracts with high early termination fees ($350 on AT&amp;T and Verizon) because, we&#8217;re told, we need to pay off the subsidy passed on to us by the carrier. So why is our monthly bill the same <em>after </em>we pass the two year mark? Shouldn&#8217;t it be lower once we pay off the phone? And shouldn&#8217;t we know the true cost of an unsubsidized phone when we&#8217;re asked to pay up to $599 for it?</p><br /><p>Goldman doesn&#8217;t ask many questions. It&#8217;s much easier to just parrot the carriers&#8217; talking points.    </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-3088055042408261500?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
