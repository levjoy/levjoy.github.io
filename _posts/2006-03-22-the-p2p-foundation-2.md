    I've been receiving updates from a group called the <a href="http://www.p2pfoundation.net/index.php/Main_Page">p2p Foundation</a> for the last few months.  It's an interesting group that is interested in the ways that peer-to-peer technology (technology that encourages the sharing of information and software among personal computers) can strengthen democratic participation.  There's a ton of information being passed around on their many sites, so check out the <a href="http://www.p2pfoundation.net/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>, the <a href="http://blog.p2pfoundation.com/">blog</a>, and the <a href="http://integralvisioning.org/index.php?topic=p2p">newsletter</a> if you're interested.
