    Today NPR launched their new <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/">Sunday Soapbox</a> feature, in which a trio of bloggers will be writing about the election and posting audio podcasts of their commentary.  It podcasts will be hosted on the Sunday Soapbox site and will air on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=10">Weekend Edition Sunday</a>.  Full disclosure: techPresident's <a href="http://www.techpresident.com/node/8#mindyfinn">Mindy Finn</a> and I are two of those three bloggers/podcasters.  We're joined by <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/about.html#faye">Faye Anderson</a>, a "citizen journalist, blogger, and publicity consultant" who blogs at <a href="http://andersonatlarge.typepad.com/">andersonatlarge.typepad.com</a>.  <p />It's an exciting chance for us to reach a wider audience with our analysis, and I'm grateful to NPR and the Weekend Edition Sunday team for the opportunity.<p />I hope you'll subscribe to our podcasts and listen in on Sundays mornings.  To whet your palette, check out Mindy's <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/2008/04/macmentum.html">podcast and post</a> about John McCain's momentum and <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/2008/04/online_trends_vs_offline_polls.html">mine</a> about offline polls and online search trends.
