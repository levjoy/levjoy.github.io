    So last week's poll revealed at least one thing: though I know it isn't true, it would seem that I have no more than two readers.  Thanks guys!  

Sorry for the lack of posting lately.  School's started and taken up nearly all of my time and the kind of headspace reserved for this kind of stuff.  I'll do my best to keep on top of it; stay with me.

I'd love to link to my boyfriend Nicholad Kristof's latest piece on Darfur, but the New York Times has introducing their suicidal <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/products/timesselect/whatis.html">TimesSelect </a> "feature."  You pay $8 a month or $50 a year for the same editorial content you were used to getting for free online.  Great deal, guys!  Hey, wanna run that series on class in America again?  If you do, only the wealthy will be able to read since it will be subscription-only. 

Anyway, in his piece Kristof once again shames the leaders of the world, not least Georgie himself, about their lack of action about Darfur.  As Kristof, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060541644/qid=1127224868/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-9572318-4659253?v=glance&amp;s=books">Samantha Power</a> and others have said, regimes like the one in Sudan will actually stop or slow genocidal behavior when they know the world is watching, and when leaders like Georgie make public statements against them.  But he hasn't been willing to even mention the subject since last year, despite the urging of his most cherished interest group, the Christian right (most of the victims in Darfur are black Christians, and the aggressors are the Janjaweed, a group of Arab Muslim militias).  So, as Kristof documents, villages continue to get destroyed, women are continually raped and mutilated, and men live in such fear of their lives they must send the women to the village well, a trip that often involves rape along the way.  But Bushie has lost interest.  

What can we do to get him to speak up?  Well, you can <a href="http://act.darfurgenocide.org/DG/MessageActionReturn.cfm">email him</a>.  He may never read what you send, but it's a start.  And check out <a href="http://www.darfurgenocide.org/index.php">darfurgenocide.org  </a>, a site with tons of resources that can get you started.  

Again, the most important thing is to get Georgie to put aside his realpolitik support for the Sudanese regime and say something against their actions.
