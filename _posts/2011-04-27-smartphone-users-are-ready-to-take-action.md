<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"> <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Smartphone users are ready to take actions: Nine out of 10 smartphone searches end in an action.</blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/26/smartphones-are-local-search-and-shopping-devices/">gigaom.com</a></div> <p>Google commissioned a study of smartphone users to see how many search for local businesses and take action on the information they find.  </p><p>It turns out that people act pretty quickly. Ryan Kim <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/26/smartphones-are-local-search-and-shopping-devices/">writes</a> that &#8220;The survey found 95 percent of smartphone users have looked for local information, with 88 percent of these users acting on information within one day, most often contacting or visiting a business.&#8221;  </p><p>There&#8217;s a ton of money to made made there, as Groupon and others already know.  </p><p>But this behavior goes beyond shopping. If people act this quickly when looking for ice cream, it&#8217;s likely that they&#8217;ll act quickly on other information as well.  </p><p>Mobile organizers know this, and they&#8217;re figuring out how to connect the ubiquity of smartphones with peoples&#8217; desire to get involved in political actions, especially via SMS, but I think we&#8217;re just at the brink of something much more exciting.</p></div></div>
