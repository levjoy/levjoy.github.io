    <p>China has gotten right into the action and pre-empted its Olympics by <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/olympics/2008/08/athleteactivist_joey_cheek_ban.html">revoking</a> the visa of a U.S. Olympic gold medalist, skater Joey Cheek.</p>
<p>It isn't because he was illegally <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/world/asia/17manners.html?n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/China">spitting in the streets</a>. When he's not racing on his blades of glory, Cheek is an organizer of <a href="http://teamdarfur.org/">Team Darfur</a>, a group of athletes raising awareness of the genocide in Darfur.</p>
<p>See, China has sorta, kinda been helping fund the Sudanese military during the time of the Darfurian genocide. China <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2008/0312-04.htm">sold</a> Sudan 90% of its arms purchases from 2003-2006, the same time those wonderful janjaweed were beginning to destroy rural Darfurian villages (Mussolini's Fallacy has <a href="http://mussolinisfallacy.blogspot.com/2008/03/china-recurring-theme.html">more</a> about that and other support for Sudan).</p>
<p>For the small crime of pushing awareness of the situation in Darfur, Cheek won't be participating in the Olympics. Can't wait to tune in to it all next week!</p>
