It's amazing the kind of cultural sway Apple has right now.  The minute they introduced the new version of iTunes, which aggregates podcasts like a newsreader would, and which offers thousands of podcasts to subsribe to like their successful music store would, podcasters' bandwidth went through the roof and suddenly <a href="http://wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,68185,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1">articles</a> appeared proclaiming the new stars of the podcast-o-sphere.  

When I first heard <a href="http://www.curry.com/">Adam Curry</a> talk about podcasting (he kind of developed the idea) on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4472935">NPR</a> all I could think of was his big hair and his tenure as one of the first VJs on MTV.  But his enthusiasm got to me; he really believed that podcasting was not just an exciting new technology, but would revolutionize the way that information is shared.  A friend was an early cheerleader as well, but I maintained my skepticism and told him I thought it was a techno-fad and would pass.

Well, I was wrong. 

Podcasting is not only the hip new thing in middle- and upper-class America, but is becoming a tool for those in the developing world to move beyond blogs and to reach a greater audience than they ever could with a local radio show.  This <a href="http://www.schanda.co.za/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4431056e-b515-483f-8a91-05b81dc8598e">Zimbabwean</a> blogger has recently come around to podcasting's possibilities, as have innumerable others in recent weeks.

So this begs the question: how long until I give it a try?

Update: If you're in Accra, Ghana, you can attend this <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/2005/07/15/podcastingvideo-blogging-workshop-in-accra-next-thursday/">podcasting/video blogging workshop</a>.  Yes, I do gauge trends' popularity by how cool they get in Africa.
