<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">T-MobileÂ quietly eliminated its $30 per month unlimited data plan for smartphones in favor of four new tiered data plans. The operator also said that if customers go over their allotted data cap they will not incur overage charges but instead will have their data speeds throttled down to an EDGE, or 2G, experience of around 100&#160;Kbps or less.</blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/t-mobile-quietly-launches-tiered-data-plans-smartphones/2011-05-23">fiercewireless.com</a></div> <p>T-Mobile joins the tiered data train, killing its unlimited plans like AT&amp;T and Verizon before it.  </p><p>Maybe this is just a rehearsal before AT&amp;T gobbles it up and makes it even more consumer-unfriendly?</p></div></div>
