    There's been tons of press about Stephen Johnson's new book, Everything Bad is Good for You, about the actual benefits of pop culture and the possibility that contemporary TV, video games, and movies are all smarter than in the past.  He thinks that  shows like the Apprentice and games like Grand Theft Auto actually help us think more quickly and make us smarter.  Check out what people have been saying on the web.  Here's the description on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573223077/qid=1115393166/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3850449-2282525?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"> Amazon.</a>  

The media's been eating up this book.  Johnson is being interviewed by Brian Lehrer on WNYC as I write this, his book is featured on the cover of Time Out NY this week, and it's in other places.  Look out for it.  This is my next assignment for myself.
