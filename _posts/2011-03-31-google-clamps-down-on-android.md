<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"> <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Google (<a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/tags/google">NASDAQ:GOOG</a>) is assuming greater control over its open-source Android mobile operating system in a bid to halt ecosystem fragmentation, informing operator and manufacturer partners it must now approve all significant tweaks to the platform.</blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/google-clamps-down-android-control-curb-fragmentation/2011-03-31">fiercemobilecontent.com</a></div> <p>There are two ways to look at this:  </p><p>1) It&#8217;s good because manufacturers and carriers invariably make a pretty great thing less great (and often crappy). </p><p>2) It&#8217;s bad because it&#8217;s less &#8220;open.&#8221;  </p><p>I tend to side with the former argument. While it&#8217;s unclear if Google&#8217;s new directive would block projects like HTC&#8217;s Sense UI (I doubt it, given how well HTC&#8217;s phones sell), it may put a stop to some other carrier customizations that do nothing but clamp down the software, install bloatware, and alter the user experience to please a few design-blind executives.</p></div></div>
