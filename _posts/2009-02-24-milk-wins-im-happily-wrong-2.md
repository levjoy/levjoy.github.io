    So, <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2009/02/09/trust-me-milk-wont-win-an-oscar/">I've rendered myself wrong</a>.  Milk ended up winning a couple of Oscars!  I'm happy that my predictions turned out to be untrue (though best picture would have been nice...). 

Sean Penn's speech was fantastic.  As <a href="http://gayrights.change.org/blog/view/sean_penn_weve_got_to_have_equal_rights_for_all">quoted</a> by Mike Jones at Change.org's Gay Rights blog: 

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Finally, for those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight...I think it is a good time for those who voted for [Proposition 8] to sit and reflect on their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren’s eyes…we’ve got to have equal rights for everyone.</blockquote>

'Nuff said.
