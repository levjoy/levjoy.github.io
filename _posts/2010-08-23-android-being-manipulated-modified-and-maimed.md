Rather than contribute to the original project of an open mobile OS, they&#8217;ve gone ahead and taken a free platform, mangled it, sometimes improved upon it, and used it to shore up their existing consumer-screwing practices (see: bloatware, price-gouging, etc.)<br /></p><p>Hiner writes, &#8220;the consequence of not putting any walls around your product is that both the good guys and the bad guys can do anything they want with it.&#8221; <br /></p><p>But Hiner is careful to point out that despite the carriers&#8217; absolute resistance to network-independent devices, Android is the opposite of the iPhone: Once it&#8217;s on your locked-down, carrier-loving phone, it&#8217;s a far more open platform &#8212; still rife with possibilities &#8212; than any other mobile OS.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-7867788070118603419?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
