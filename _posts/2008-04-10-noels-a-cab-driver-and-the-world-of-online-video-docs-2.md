    Just a note that Noel Hidalgo -- <a href="http://luckofseven.com/">world traveler</a>, open source evangelist, and former bearded man -- is back in the U.S. after a year of travel and is producing a web doc on being a taxi driver.



I like where he's going with this; the possibilities of sustained, serial online video documentaries are just beginning to be explored, though projects like <a href="http://purplestates.tv">Purple States</a> are doing an amazing job.
