In a word, the wedding was amazing.  It will take time to process everything, but it was easily one of the best days of my life.  Having my family and friends in the same place together for a weekend truly enjoying themselves was a great feeling.  We're off to Spain tomorrow for two weeks, but in my place please welcome Rosanne, a good friend and spectacular gossip queen.  So while this blog seeks to question the use of real news stories next to foofy news stories, the next couple of weeks will see an upswing in the foof.  

Enjoy.
