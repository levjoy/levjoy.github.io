Great news!  The original <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20050612/ap_en_mu/britain_pink_floyd"> Pink Floyd </a>lineup is slated to play at the Live 8 concert in July!  

Who cares?  

Well, David Gilmour (who's dreamy guitar solos on <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> confused me as a teenager) has his heart in a good place: "Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G-8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world.'  Sincere. 

But the Live 8 lineup, which was put together by Adrian Belew, has been criticized for not having any actual <em>African</em> people in it, which is bizarre considering this is a concert for Africa.  I may be a good thing that this Floyd news captures attention for the event, but if it just becomes another starry concert (but does Pink Floyd even qualify?  I wasn't even born when Dark Side came out.  Why don't they just invite the Moody Blues?) I'm  thinking the attention might be taken away from, um, poverty and hunger.
