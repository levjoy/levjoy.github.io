    <p>Steven Johnson, one of my very favorite writers, <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2008/06/turning-40.html">turned 40</a> today. Among other ruminations is this one, on time:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
  <p>The older I get, the more I think that one of the keys to happiness—or at least one of the signs of happiness—is getting to some kind of place where time seems to be passing at the right speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good goal, I think.</p>
