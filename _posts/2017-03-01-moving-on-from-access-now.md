I just sent out this email:

"Friday, March 3, will be my last day as Advocacy Director at Access Now.

After nearly three years at Access Now I am moving on to focus on a new project, in which I'm seeking to coordinate digital security experts and connect them to civil society organizations and high-risk communities in need. I'll be undertaking this project through a non-resident fellowship at Stanford's Digital Civil Society Lab and via partnerships with other individuals and institutions.

It has been a great pleasure to work with the insanely talented and dedicated Access Now team and our many excellent partners around the world in the fight for the digital rights of internet users at risk -- a cohort that, unfortunately, is growing its ranks every day. I look forward to working with many of you in the weeks and months ahead as we continue to build protections for civil society and to advocate for the fundamental rights of all people, online and offline."

It's all true. More details forthcoming!
