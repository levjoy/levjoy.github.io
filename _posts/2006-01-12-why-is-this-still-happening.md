How is it that the authorities in Saudi Arabia can continue to let <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-01-12T145427Z_01_DIT247894_RTRUKOC_0_US-HAJ-SAUDI.xml">this</a> happen? This is the second time in two weeks that a large group of people have died during haj.  The West continually lets that country slide for it's insane human rights abuses and neglect of common peoples's lives.  And remember when all those schoolgirls died in a fire because male firefighters weren't allowed into the girls-only school to save them?

How is it that, in 2006, we can still let this kind of bullshit happen?
