I usually don't care about celebrity relationships unless I know that celebrity (and I don't know any celebrities), but as I've said before, I kind of like the Pitt/Jolie affair.  So I'm glad to see that they are <a href="http://news.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHASoItAJJ-Bts/3x-0&amp;fp=43c6877f95304ca7&amp;ei=2GPGQ8b5G8GaaMrJzbgH&amp;url=http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4604594.stm&amp;cid=1103420040">expecting a baby</a>.  It's kind of like the new Woody Allen and Mia Farrow power couple, except that unlike Woody, Brad actually seems to be concerned about the world south of East 59th Street.

I hope they adopt ten more babies from around the world and spend millions more on beds for victims of disaster.  Who cares if they're from Hollywood?  It's a pretty good example they're setting, don't you think?
