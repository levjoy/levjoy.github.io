My <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/sundaysoapbox/2008/05/obama_power_1.html">newest post</a> is up on NPR, in which I do a very quick overview of the many ways Barack Obama is consolidating power in the Democratic Party.
<blockquote>For whatever reasons, it's clear that Obama is busy building a  parallel Democratic infrastructure and movement. Washington-based 527s  and Democratic loyalists may end up crying foul, but progressives  across the country will benefit from more money and influence than  they've had in years. Are they making a Faustian deal or witnessing  the birth of a new Democratic Party?</blockquote>
Check out the whole thing, and stay tuned for a crisp audio reproduction of it.
