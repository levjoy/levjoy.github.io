    <p>The caucuses are finally here, and I'm not watching the results on TV. I don't have CNN or MSNBC or any other cable news station, and I don't have a lot of patience for watching the caucusing in real time on C-SPAN.</p>
<p>But I do have Twitter.</p>
<p>And I've got to say, following my Twitter friends' conversation has been educational.</p>
<p>Patrick Ruffini, who's gathering caucusgoers' tweets at <a href="http://twitter.com/iowacaucus">twitter.com/iowacaucus</a>, has already said he thinks Obama will win for the Dems. It's far too early though, methinks, but his Twitter feed is a great way to get numbers.<br /></p>
<p>I'm also listening to the inimitable Brian Lehrer on WNYC, the New York-area NPR affiliate.</p>
<p>A special <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/mpl?moduleurl=http://www.google.com/mapfiles/mapplets/iowacaucus/iowacaucus.xml&amp;utm_campaign=en">Google Maps mashup</a> is supposed to be charting the results in real time, but I haven't seen anything yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iowacaucusresults.com/">Iowacaucusresults.com</a> is showing the Democratic results, and at the moment John Edwards is leading the Democratic pack.</p>
<p>Super blogger <a href="http://andycarvin.com/">Andy Carvin</a> just twittered "Let's all pause for a moment to cross our fingers and hope that Twitter doesn't crash tonight." He's got that right.</p>
