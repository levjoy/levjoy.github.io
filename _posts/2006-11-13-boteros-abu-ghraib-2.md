</span>Fernando Botero, who is known by some for his paintings of Rubensque (full-figured) women that celebrate chubby bodies rather than mock them, has recently released a <a href="http://www.marlboroughgallery.com/artists/botero/artwork.html">series of paintings</a> of Abu Ghraib prisoners.  They are haunting, and manage to bring the same sense of humanity to this scandal of scandals.
