    Just a quick note to say that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368794/">I'm Not There</a> -- the Todd Haynes movie "about" Dylan -- was utterly fantastic, one of the best, most unexpectedly moving films I've seen in a long, long time.  

I walked out of the theater unable to control my emotions.  It just brought out too many of them.  I always like it when I can't express how I feel about something, when it gets me in that deep-down way.  This did that. 

I'm not sure how non-Dylan fans would take this film; it might just confuse the hell out of them.  I'm not even sure how surefire Dylan fans will respond.  But I don't care.  It brought him and his music, which I already feel so close to, even closer to me.
