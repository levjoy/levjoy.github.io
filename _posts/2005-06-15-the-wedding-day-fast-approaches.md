This is my last post for a while, as my wedding is in just three days.  Exciting, bewildering, and more.  Although Nicole and I have taken care of almost every little detail, little things keep popping up.  This is to be expected, of course, but I can't wait for the day to come and for all of the details to be wrapped up.  Execution.  Then, off to Spain for two weeks of unclenching and tooling around.  I'll be back the first week of July.  Mark it on your calendars.  I'm expecting all of you to stay with me till then.
