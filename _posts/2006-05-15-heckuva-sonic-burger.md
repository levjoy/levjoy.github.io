This has been circulated around the blogosphere, but it's too good to pass up.

The emails of ex-FEMA chief Michael Brown have been released under the Freedom of Information Act, <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/read-michael-browns-e-mails/">Open Source </a>tells us.  And there are some juicy tidbits in there.

The most blogged-about item so far is a little communiqué from Brownie to his press secretary written as the post-Katrina mess unfolded (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>Just so you know, this is old news. The term refugee is forbidden here. These are Americans who are hurricane victims, they are evacuees displaced from their homes. I am tired, no, angered, by charges of racism. You know that neither me nor anyone associated with me is a racist. Grrrr.
<strong>How was that Sonic burger?</strong></blockquote>Check our the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/katrina/report.aspx?aid=484">Center for Public Integrity</a> for more.
