The New Orleans tragedy has reminded many people of things they'd forgotten (or would rather forget) are happening in America  &#151; institutional racism, neglect of the poor, and our barely functioning government, for example &#151; and one thing that has emerged is the power of photographs and the ways they can be manipulated.  The classic example, of course, is the looter/scavenger couplet that exposes all too clearly the arbitrary (and prejudiced) way we apply labels.  There's also the use of pictures of despairing people, a la starving Africans, in order to gain sympathy for their plight.  

Is there room for humor here?  Of course there is, and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing </a>found it.

What song do you think Georgie is singing here?
