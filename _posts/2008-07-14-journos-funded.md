<p>A few days ago I <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2008/07/09/fund-the-journos/">begged</a>, no, pleaded with you to help fund David Cohn's <a href="http://wiki.spot.us/envirodetails">first experiment</a> in community-funded journalism, via the the freshly-launched <a href="http://spot.us/">Spot.us</a>.</p>
<p>It worked: Alex Madrigal <a href="http://wiki.spot.us/envirodetails">raised</a> $250 from folks like you and me to go out and research and write a piece on the role of ethanol in the California energy industry. Congrats to Alex and David!</p>
