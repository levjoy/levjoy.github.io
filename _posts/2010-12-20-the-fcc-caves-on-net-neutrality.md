<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Instead of protecting openness on wireless Internet devices like the iPhone and Droid, the Commission has exempted the mobile Internet from Net Neutrality protections. This move enshrines Verizon and AT&amp;T as gatekeepers to the expanding world of mobile Internet access, allowing them to favor their own applications while blocking, degrading or de-prioritizing others.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/obama-fcc-caves-on-net-ne_b_799435.html">huffingtonpost.com</a></div><br /><p>I&#8217;m on family leave through December, but like the rest of my colleagues and peers in media reform movement, I&#8217;ll be paying close attention to tomorrow&#8217;s FCC meeting to vote on on proposed Net Neutrality rules (the meeting starts at 10am; you can watch the livestream and join a live chat <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/FCCmeeting">here</a>). <br /></p><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/fcc-rule/">No one is happy</a> with the proposed rules except for telecoms like AT&amp;T and Verizon, who likely helped write them. There are simply not enough protections for Internet users from companies that want to cable-ize the Internet, charging extra for popular sites and even blocking sites that compete with their own offerings. Don&#8217;t listen to FCC Chairman Genachowski or anyone else who claims these rules enforce Net Neutrality; they don&#8217;t. <br /></p><p>Perhaps worst of all, wireless will be almost completely unprotected. See the Tim Karr quote above &#8212; almost no Net Neutrality protections will exist for those of us accessing the Internet on smartphones (which, by 2014, will be most of us). <br /></p><p>Tomorrow looks to be a dark day in the fight for free speech online and consumer protections from overreaching corporations. Heave a sigh.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-897578423232087379?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
