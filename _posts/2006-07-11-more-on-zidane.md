Because I'm obsessed.Â  What did Meterazzi say to him? According to a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5169342.stm">deaf British lip reader</a>, he said "you're the son of a terrorist whore."

The BBC ten o'clock news also reported:
<blockquote>[Meterazzi] then accused him of being a "liar" and wished "an ugly death to you and your family" on the day the Frenchman's mother had been taken to hospital ill. This was followed by "Go f*** yourself".</blockquote>If you're more on the pro-Italy side of things, check out this <a href="http://tonaz.altervista.org/zidane.html">game</a>, which I'm sure Zidane would not be pleased with.

<strong>Update: </strong>The game is down, because people are apparently accessing it too much, or something (my Italian isn't what it used to be).
