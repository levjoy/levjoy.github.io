            So it's almost the end of the year.&nbsp; Over the past few months I finally adjusted to the graduate school schedule.&nbsp; When I first started, I was so used to the artificial busy-ness of office life that I didn't know how to structure my time.&nbsp; But this past semester I finally started to get how to do it. <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/levjoy/79171871/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/79171871_9e212f0edc_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a><br /> <br /><br />Before I knew it school ended and I managed something resembling a finished version of my pigeon movie, Pigeon People, which you can watch <a href="http://levjoy.com/video/pigeon-people.mov">here</a>.&nbsp; I'm pretty happy with it.&nbsp; When I first started thinking about it I was watching a lot of Italian neo-realism, and I wanted to use the techniques I was learning about like depth of field, location shooting,<br />etc..&nbsp; All of those things are part of documentary filmmaking, but I wanted to go a little further in to the verite side of things.&nbsp; The result is less a sociological look at men and the pigeons they keep and<br />more of a meditation on how men think of themselves and their relationship to the world.&nbsp; At least I'd like to think so. <br /><br />I also produced a sound project which I haven't thrown online just yet; I'm waiting to put it to some video before I let anyone hear it.&nbsp;Needless to say, it was great fun and it stoked my enthusiasm for<br />playing music and creating "sound projects." <br /><br />And finally, I wrote an essay/wiki called <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://levjoy.com/essaywiki">Social Software for Social Change</a> </span>in which I look at the recent trends in open source technology and social software and examine ways to use them for social change.&nbsp; It's a big topic and I don't feel like I even scratched the surface in the essay.&nbsp; Nevertheless, check it out and add to the wiki if you feel like it. <br /><br />The end of the year has been strangely hectic.&nbsp; Nicole and I spend four days in Northampton which were great and relaxing, and then came straight home to greet my parents in my house.&nbsp; I cooked them and my brother (he of <a href="http://www.levytheband.com/">Levy</a> fame) a delicious salmon and couscous dinner.&nbsp; After a day and half of putting away all of my new stuff, correcting exams, and finishing up loose ends with other work, it's off to Montauk with Mike and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliviagatti">Olivia</a> tomorrow for two days of year-ending debauchery.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is any of this interesting to anybody but me?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But sometimes we need to lay out what's been going on and what is on the horizon in order to get a sense of it for ourselves. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />A year and half ago I left my sexy job as a textbook editor and started program in <a href="http://ima.hunter.cuny.edu/">integrated media arts</a> at Hunter College.<a href="http://levjoy.com/essaywiki"><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></a>&nbsp; At the time I thought I'd end up doing work similar to what I had been doing -- overseeing other people's work and acting as some sort of gatekeeper -- but instead I've discovered that I love making films, tinkering with web sites, and talking about online communities.&nbsp; I'll do my best in the coming year to make those passions work as a career.&nbsp;In the meantime, I'll keep writing away.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/newyears" rel="tag">newyears</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/montauk" rel="tag">montauk</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Levy" rel="tag">Levy</a>
