Remember way back when when I promised that I'd be writing about my new project?  It's been a few months, but I'm actually doing it now, except that the writing is on another site.  Check it out <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/reallife">here</a>; it's a blog I set up to document my work the project, which is a machinima documentary about progressive activism in Second Life.  Have no idea what I'm talking about?  Neither do I...

Be warned that the blog (and the project itself) is very, very incomplete.  But that's part of the fun.  The blog is meant to document my process as I set out to find out how activism is happening in Second Life, and as I learn how to navigate the world myself.  Read more about it on the <a href="http://levjoy.com/reallife/?page_id=2">about page</a>. 

I'll be posting there more frequently than I post here, and stay tuned for video excerpts from my travels.
