    In response to <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2005/11/21/the-participation-revolution/#comments">last week's post</a> about whether social software designers are thinking politically about their work and about whether social software can serve the public interest, fostering civic participation.  <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog">Chris Messina</a>, a developer of the<a href="http://flock.com"> Flock </a>web browser, responded:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">In fact, weâ€™re designing Flock to serve that very purpose, considering the citizen journalism angles and working to build a suite of tools that can be used to re-democratize media.</blockquote>
That's encouraging.  I often fear that some web services like MySpace or Flickr are used as 21st century vanity plates, places for people to admire themselves and their collections of friends.  I tried Friendster back in the day but it seemed pointless; I wasn't really friends with many of my Friendster friends, yet I felt the bizarre need to collect more of them every time I came across someone with like 750 Friendsters.
