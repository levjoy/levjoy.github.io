Hossein Derakhshan, also known as <a href="http://hoder.com/weblog/">Hoder</a>, the blogger, is an Iranian-Canadian living in Toronto who writes a hugely popular blog in both English and Persian that, he says, boasts 20,000 Farsi-language readers a day. <br /><br />This week, Hoder made a trip to Israel as a <a href="http://hoder.com/weblog/archives/014928.shtml">citizen journalist and a peace activist.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; In his words, he wants to<br /><br /><blockquote>show my 20,000 daily Iranian readers what Israel really looks like and how people live there. The Islamic Republic has long portrayed Israel as an evil state, with a consensual political agenda of killing every single man and woman who prays to Allah, including Iranians.<p>I'm going to challenge that image. <br /></p></blockquote><br />Hoder also wrote this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/opinion/28Derakhshan.html?_r=1">scathing attack</a> in the Times on the U.S. government's hypocrisy when it comes to promoting democracy abroad.<br /><br />He's doing important work not only by traveling to Israel, but by promoting blogging along the way --&nbsp;  he helped Farhad Moradian, an Iranian Israeli, set up a new blog, <a href="http://nissantelaviv.blogspot.com/">Ginsburg Cafe</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br /><br /><br />Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Hoder" rel="tag">Hoder</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Iran" rel="tag">Iran</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Israel" rel="tag">Israel</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/democracy" rel="tag">democracy</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/citizen%20journalism" rel="tag">citizen journalism</a>
