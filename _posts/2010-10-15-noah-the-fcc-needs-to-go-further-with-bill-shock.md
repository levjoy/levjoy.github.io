<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">The FCC rule shouldn&#8217;t just compel cell phone companies to give consumers conspicuous warnings before they rack up big overages. They should make such overages impossible.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2271183/pagenum/all/#p2">slate.com</a></div><br /><p>How about that? Slate&#8217;s Timothy Noah <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2271183/pagenum/all/#p2">thinks</a> the FCC&#8217;s proposed &#8220;bill shock&#8221; rule &#8212; which would compel cell phone companies to give consumers adequate warning before they rack up overage charges &#8212; isn&#8217;t strong enough. He suggests the FCC tell the carriers to actually stop consumers&#8217; use of data when they hit a limit &#8212; and then ask the consumers if they&#8217;d like to continue going over. Seems fair to me, for both sides.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-5488117970455663842?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
