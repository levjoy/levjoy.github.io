    Ben Smith, inimitable blogger and reporter for the <a href="http://www.politico.com/" title="Politics, Political News, Campaign 2008 - Politico.com">Politico</a> and co-author, with his wife, of <a href="http://ditmaspark.blogspot.com/">my favorite neighborhood blog</a>, <a href="http://ditmaspark.blogspot.com/">writes</a> that our congresswoman, Yvette Clarke was rated <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=373&amp;Itemid=33">the worst</a> member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">This may not be quite fair: She’s been ill for part of her first year, taking a six-week leave, and missed many of the votes on which the ratings were based.

Politico also reports today that Clarke is the only Freshman not to have introduced any legislation at all on the House floor.</blockquote>
At least we’re getting a <a href="http://ditmaspark.blogspot.com/2007/09/new-restaurant.html">new restaurant</a> down the street.
