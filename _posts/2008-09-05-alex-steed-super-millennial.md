I haven't mentioned yet on this fair blog, but my friend <a href="http://www.alexsteed.com">Alex Steed</a>, scribe of <a href="http://makesomethinghappen.net/">Make Something Happen</a>, fellow New Englander, and all-around super guy is setting out next month for a whirlwhind tour of these fair States to find out just what makes twentysomething activists tick.  (We at <a href="http://www.change.org">Change.org</a> are giving him a hand with a few aspects).<br /><br />He's rightly grabbing attention for the project.  From <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/2008/09/05/us-tour-highlights-online-youth-activism/">Save the Internet</a>: <br /><br /><blockquote><p>But what sets Steed and other millennial activists apart isn’t<br />so much age – it’s how they participate in activism. Steed<br />says that millennial activists are defined by a sense of “digital<br />fluency” and leverage most of their social and political power<br />using the Internet.</p><p>“The same way that for many people activism means a particular<br />set of things, like picket signs or making phone calls at a phone bank,<br />to the millennial, I think one of the top three techniques will always<br />include the connectivity provided by the Internet,” Steed said.</p><p>Indeed, Steed himself is a self-proclaimed millennial activist,<br />relying on the Internet for much of his social organizing. But<br />he’s fascinated by the way people only a few years younger than<br />he is are harnessing the Internet to create change in increasingly<br />creative and effective ways.</p></blockquote><br /><br />Go Alex! <br />
