<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>If this situation is going to be fixed, two things need to happen. First, users need to demonstrate &#8212; loudly and with their wallets &#8212; that these practices are not acceptable. </p><p>Second, Google must take a stand for the end user and insist that parts of Android must be included on every device in order to bear the Google name &#8212; and that all carrier installed apps and services are easily and freely able to be removed by users at their discretion.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/12/entelligence-will-carriers-destroy-the-android-vision/">engadget.com</a></div><br /><p>Michael Gartenberg joins the ranks of the incensed at the carriers&#8217; abuse of Android, singling out the Samsung Galaxy series as the most egregious example of bloatware and lockdowns mucking a perfectly good phone. <br /></p><p>One thing that differentiates this post from others is that Gartenberg is proposing actions to end the chaos. <br /></p><p>First, the standard &#8220;vote with your wallet&#8221; which, given the fractured Android landscape, doesn&#8217;t help much. How to avoid the bloat? Does Gartenberg want us to buy an iPhone? A discontinued Nexus One? <br /></p><p>Second, and less likely, is that Google should take a stand for its platform and insist that the carriers stop degrading Android. But until such degradation ceases to make Google some extra cash, that&#8217;s unlikely to happen. <br /></p><p>Both solutions are milquetoast at best, but they&#8217;re a start.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-8516373782980401795?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
