I'm in Austin at the <a href="http://netrootsnation.com/">Netroots Nation</a> conference (formerly YearlyKos, but they wanted to imply more independence from <a href="http://dailykos.com">DailyKos</a>) and I have to say, I'm enjoying it more than I expected.  Maybe it's because I'm here with a <a href="http://www.change.org/bloggers">specific agenda</a>, but I'm loving hanging out with a community built around hardcore partisan ideas like guaranteeing health care to people, creating green policy, electing Obama, etc.  <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">Personal Democracy Forum</a> is fantastic, of course, but I'm finding it refreshing to be around people who are unashamed -- in fact, empowered -- to be advocating for a progressive agenda. <br /><br />Last night Wesley Clark (yawn) and Howard Dean (yay) spoke to us about what it means to be Democrats and Americans, or something like that.  Here's a pic of Ho-Ho, in which you can sort of make out his snappy patrician suit: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69431075@N00/2680580354"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/2680580354_429d478bc0.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br />Anyhow, I may report again, but if not it's only because I'm enjoying a few too many bottles of Lone Star beer and hanging wout with some truly fantastic folks. <br /><br />If you aren't here but for some reason care about what I'm doing, best thing to do is to check out <a href="http://www.twitter.com/levjoy">my Tweets</a>.
