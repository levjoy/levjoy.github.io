<p>Nicholas Negroponte, purveyor of the $100<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4292854.stm"> laptop</a>, is giving at <a href="http://kayeplayhouse.hunter.cuny.edu/calendar.shtml#nov">talk today</a> the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter.&nbsp; I'm so excited to hear him since he'll be addressing the very things on my agenda this semester.&nbsp; If you're around NY and interested, try to show up.&nbsp; If this laptop is produced -- crank battery and funky-folding casing in two -- it could be a very positive step for those worried about the digital divide. <br /></p><!-- technorati tags begin --><p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digital divide" rel="tag">digital divide</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/$100 laptop" rel="tag">$100 laptop</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/negroponte" rel="tag">negroponte</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->
