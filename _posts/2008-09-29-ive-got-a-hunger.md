A <a href="http://www.change.org/ben">friend and colleague</a> has started a cool new mashup of everyone's two favorite things: food and Obama.  The idea is to simply host a dinner with friends, ask everyone to donate a certain amount to the Obama campaign, and have each attendee host their own dinner in return. 

It's called <a href="http://hungryforobama.com/">Hungry for Obama</a>, and it's catching on, in part because of this cool logo:

 It's easy to sign up and get started, so if you believe in Obama, and if you believe in food, get cooking.
