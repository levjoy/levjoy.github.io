    I can't understand why people aren't more open to wind power.  It's such an amazing thing--power at our fingertips if we harness it right.  But some people don't like the look of turbines.  I think they're beautiful.  Check out the post below at WorldChanging:

<br />
<p>MIT's <a href="http://www.techreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/forward_wind.asp">Technology Review</a> has a recent article on the growth of wind power--not just in terms of global market share, but the size of the turbines themselves:<br />
</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<br />
"Today's largest commercial wind turbine has a blade span of 104 meters and produces up to 3.6 megawatts of electricityenough to power 1,000 average U.S. households. But in February, Repower Systems of Germany switched on a demonstration turbine near Hamburg that produces five megawatts and has a blade span of 126 meters. And General Electric is developing a design for a 70-meter blade, which translates to a total blade span topping 140 meters...</blockquote>

<p>" 'The economics work better as the turbines get biggerand the name of the game is economics'...  The goal of industry and federal researchers is to create wind farms that produce electricity for about three cents per kilowatt-hour, down from about 4.5 cents today; that would beat the cost of fuel for the most efficient new gas-fired power plantscurrently about 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour...</p>

<p>"Still, relying on superbig machines is not without risk... The bigger the turbines get, the higher the cost if one of them fails.  'Sooner or later, they are going to make one too big...and they are going to lose their shirt.' "<br />
