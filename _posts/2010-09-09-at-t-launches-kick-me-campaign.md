<p>[Update: More quotes below]</p><br /><p>AT&amp;T just launched a PR blitz using every flack&#8217;s weapon of choice: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ATT">Facebook</a>. The site was announced via emails &#8220;sent&#8221; by AT&amp;T execs to consumers, promising an investment of $18-$19 billion in wireless and wireline networks in 2010. </p><br /><p>The company&#8217;s resident social media guru may have <em>slightly</em> underestimated the absolute blitz of negative comments (TechCrunch calls it a &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/08/customer-service-in-a-brave-new-world-att-puts-a-finger-in-the-dam/">tower of hate</a>&#8221;) this tactic would inspire. See, when you create an online, public platform for comments, <em>you can&#8217;t control those comments</em>.</p><br /><p>Here&#8217;s a glimpse of what consumers are writing: </p><br /><p>&#8220;I love the iphone, but AT&amp;T has found a way to ruin my iphone experience. The phone is nearly useless now and either drops every call or the person on the other end can&#8217;t hear me.&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;So glad I&#8217;m not the only one with ATT problems. Recently, I&#8217;ve noticed extensive drops on the route from my home to work. This literally just started in the last 6 weeks. I would expect my service to get *better* over time.&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;I am forced to give up my iPhone with AT&amp;T after two years this month. Last week I was in LAX and desperately needed to call a friend to let her know that my flight was cancelled after a five hour mechanical and that I&#8217;d be arriving at a much later time and at a different airport in D.C. Many times her phone never rang but the minutes kept running.&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;&#8230; just two weeks ago I spoke to customer service about constant dropped calls or calls that don&#8217;t even go through to begin with (still happening), 1-2 bars most of the time and i&#8217;m thinking my phone (yes iphone) is having issues. I call customer service and the representative tells me that there is nothing wrong with my phone.&#8221;</p><br /><p>To be fair, there&#8217;s a sprinkling of goodwill mixed in. But for the most part, folks are just being honest: AT&amp;T&#8217;s service sucks. </p><br /><p><br /></p><p>Here&#8217;s some more from later in the day &#8212; these are all from within the last 15 minutes.</p><br /><p>&#8220;Kinda sucks that you have to &#8216;like&#8217; AT&amp;T before you can talk about what you don&#8217;t like. Let me be clear &#8212; AT&amp;T still exists because of the iPhone!&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;While everything you have said in you latest email is encouraging&#8230;. the coverage that AT&amp;T provides for phone service is AWFUL!!!!&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;I too find if comical that AT&amp;T has asked for the public&#8217;s opinion. Look&#8212;when it works it works and then the only issue really is that AT&amp;T has been gouging us for this and for that.&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;Hi, I own the iPhone 3Gs. Every since the Iphone 4 was released, my husband and I keep getting dropped calls and hardly ever get a good cellular signal anymore. We live in the Chicago area and normally service was good&#8230;&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;Coverage is crap in san Francisco! I get better service in the middle of the ocean in Hawaii than in one of the biggest cities!&#8221;</p><br /><p>&#8220;Response to letter from &#8216;Chris Penrose&#8217; - After moving to Magnolia TX, my service has been more than terrible. Numerous calls to customer service, dropped calls, no service at times.&#8221;</p><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-2164618180366330807?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
