    Actually, uncle's house, but you get the drift.  Like a lot of people, I love Thanksgiving week and the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.  There's just something about it.  Mundane tasks seem to take on more meaning, there are plenty of reasons to eat and drink and not feel guilty about it, etc.  

I know that this has all been said before, but so what?
