<blockquote>GENEVA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Tuesday that it had received less than a quarter of the $550 million sought for quake victims in Pakistan and that the lack of money could soon hamper efforts to save lives in remote areas.</blockquote>This is simply unbelievable.&#038;nbsp; This report came out just a day before the numbers of dead in Pakistan were revised to over <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4399576.stm">73,000.</a>

If the U.N. has received less than $130 million or so, that means that the U.S. has donated far below it's fair share.&#038;nbsp; In a time when Bill Gates, a private citizen (of course, the most wealthy private citizen in the world) donates over <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/31/233237&amp;from=rss">$750 million in one day</a> to help eradicate malaria, can't the U.S. government cough up even a third of that to help people who are in danger of dying <em>right now</em>?&#038;nbsp; Call me idealistic, but it's absurd.&#038;nbsp;

Of course, we have to spend money investigating Georgie and his cronies' ineptitude.&#038;nbsp; So what if a few dozen thousand Pakistanis die of cold and exposure before winter even hits?&#038;nbsp; I'm sure where they're going, like the New Orleanians who were forced by Katrina to move, is better than where they live now, right, Barb?
