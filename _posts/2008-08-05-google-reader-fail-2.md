<p>After spending the morning scrolling through my feeds in Google Reader, I realized that, out of thousands of posts that were written in the last week or so, I was only interested in reading a handful. The signal to noise ration is disturbingly out of whack.</p>
<p>This has been the pattern for the last month or so. Is it just the summer slowdown or is Google Reader -- and all traditional feed-reading -- simply failing me?<br /></p>
<p>I'm thinking about jumping ship and trying out alternative schemes for a while, like recently bookmarked <a href="http://delicious.com/levjoy1">Delicious</a> links (love that new design!), Netvibes, or something else. What do you do?</p>
