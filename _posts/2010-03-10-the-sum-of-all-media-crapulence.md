    <p>This piece by the HuffPo's Jason Linkins perfectly skewers a political press which, frankly, has been asking for it for a long time. 
</p><p>I too have become frustrated with the way the <em>Times</em>, the <em>Post</em> and others have been obsessing over how Obama cronies like David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel are portrayed in the media, how they are using the media, how they are failed by the media, disappointed in the media, etc., etc.  
</p><p>Coverage of the administration has become coverage of how insiders are handling the media. Writes Linkin: 
</p><p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Rahm Emanuel! Suddenly, he is Ground Zero for so much media crapulence. Suddenly, he is the protagonist of the most fevered "who's up/who's down" narratives. Slowly, and then all at once, the media has become filled with the tales of Rahm's agonies and ecstasies. Good lord, even Eric Massa is cashing in on the zeitgeist, casting Emanuel as a bit player in his ongoing operatic nonsense. And the best part is that he gets the nude scene! This raises many questions, not the least of which is: does Rahm perceive his ability to persuade to be related to his nudity?  </blockquote>
<p>It's all down to perception of coverage and coverage of perception. What about the HCR bill? The actual people in America who need jobs? 
</p><p>Again, Linkins says it best: 
</p><p /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">And, uhm, David Axelrod? What is going on with him? The New York Times says that nobody "has taken the perceived failings of the administration more personally or shown the strain as plainly as" him. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are out of work. They'll let David Axelrod know when they have the time to tend to the hard strain of soft perception.</blockquote>
