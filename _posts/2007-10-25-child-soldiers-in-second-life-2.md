    Just came across this:

It just took place in Teen Second Life, and was covered <a href="http://www.holymeatballs.org/2007/10/slinternteen_ishmael_beah_my_1.html">here</a>.  After covering the Virtual Darfur build in my <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/betterworld">film</a> about Second Lif e, and finding no one there, it's encouraging to see SL being used to connect teens to politics and international issues.

I just talked to a reporter about politics and SL today, and she was simultaneously making fun of it and flabbergasted by it.  Like a lot of people, she wanted to know if it is the next big thing to replace MySpace or if it's dying a slow death.  Black and white.  I said that although we don't know what the specific future of SL might be, there's no way of predicting the eventual impact of networked 3-D spaces; it's still be less than 15 years since the web showed up.

When we go to a politician's build or a sparsely attended event in SL, we want to make some sort of generalization about it's irrelevance.  But it isn't that easy; events like the above show us that, for physically dispersed people looking to connect, it can be a very compelling tool
