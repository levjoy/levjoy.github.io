    Finally, at long last, the blog is here.  There isn't much to report except that I saw Seymour Hersh, Frank Rich, and Naomi Klein speak at the Aronson Award event here at Hunter.  They were inspiring, wonderful, indignant, funny.  Hersh has a great philosophy about what he's doing--"pissing on the shoes of the people in Washington," he said--that is very existentialist and funny (existentialism is funny sometimes).  When asked why he tracks down stories like Abu Graib or My Lai, he said (to paraphrase) that he doesn't expect his work to change anything, for George Bush to behave differently because of his exposes.  When asked what motivates him, he said, "What else can I do?"  A wonderful answer.
