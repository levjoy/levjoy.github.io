My good friend Olivia started a blog called <a href="http://beyondtheshelves.blogspot.com/">Beyond the Shelves</a> that she's using to document her graduate library work at <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/gslis/">Simmons College</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; always like it when my friends start blogging after making fun of me for doing it (okay, Liv never made fun of me, but I'm sensitive).&nbsp; I'm also a fan of the process-blog, or what I will be calling the prblog (problog? pblog?) in which people work through ideas without worrying about consistency or, in my case, coherency.&nbsp; Like traditional journals, prblogs offer a way of externalizing our thoughts, of making them clearer, but with the added plus (or minus) of having an audience to bounce your ideas off of.&nbsp; If they aren't assholes, of course. <br /><br />
