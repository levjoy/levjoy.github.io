<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4209480.stm">This</a> is a great, great idea.  Jeremy Faludi from <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003467.html">WorldChanging</a> thinks the time is right for this kind of project:

<blockquote>I think the internet has lowered the bar enough that it's now easy and fast, and I hope we see more of it. I'd like to see this happen on a broader scale, with people in low-income areas of Africa, southeast Asia, and Latin America, as well.</blockquote>

I'd like to see projects started in which people write blogs together from different parts of the world, so that they can communicate with each other and others can see the ongoing conversation.  The big stumbling blocks are, of course, access to computers (we need to <i>get</i> the technology to places that don't have it, and the energy to power it; small potatoes, right?) and teaching people how to use the necessary software.  

I'm making it my goal to figure out how to do this: how to set up these sorts of blogs and how to implement the technology to help people use them, and how to make it worthwhile for people.  Not only would it be beneficial for the actual bloggers, but those of us reading would witness a new kind of self-portrait painting in which folks like the Afghan villagers involved in the BBC project develop an online persona for the world to see, a potentially remarkable construction of a new self, free of border disputes, civil wars and other other dangers.
