    The latest distraction is this <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=708380"> business </a> with Paula Abdul and an American Idol contestant.  He claims that she coached him and they had an affair, and blah blah blah...

I understand why American Idol is so popular.  I think I get it.  It's like American Bandstand or something.  But why is this news, and the news about ABC's "investigation," getting so much press?  It's like meta-press: the press is excited that ABC did something journalistic.  It ranks right up there with Hersh's story about Abu Ghraib!
