<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/video/6765.html?cnn=yes">According </a>to the CEO of Impact Mobile, Gary Schwartz, the mobile browser is the ultimate app. &#8220;It happened on the desktop from widgets to browser. Now we are seeing this in an accelerated fashion with mobile thanks to HTML5,&#8221; he said.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.bizreport.com/2010/11/app-pocolypse-for-the-mobile-app.html">bizreport.com</a></div><br /><p>It&#8217;s been incredible to watch the iPhone take off over the last two years or so &#8212; as the number, and quality, of apps has risen. <br /></p><p>I&#8217;m no fan of the lack of &#8220;generativity&#8221; walled-gardens and app stores inspire, but this much is obvious: Easily downloadable and useful apps helped the iPhone make the leap from early adopter to soccer mom. <br /></p><p>At this point, it would be a tough sell to ask all the non-techies who love their iPhones to start typing in URLs into mobile Safari, even if that practice eventualy mirrors the current app store experience. Generativity or no, it&#8217;s pretty fun to install an app.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-3804197018903748102?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
