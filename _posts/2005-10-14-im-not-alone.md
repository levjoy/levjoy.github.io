I think people think I hate Apple because I dare to take a skeptical look at their offerings and question whether their intense, uncritical commercialism is a good thing.  But <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2127924/nav/tap1/">Jack Shafer</a> on Slate also sees this as the press giving out free kisses to any and every Apple product introduced to the market.  

Shafer says that Apple's marketing campaigns spread the idea that Apple is cool, and that if you buy Apple products, you are a de facto hipster:

<blockquote>Apple incites fanaticism about its products via ad campaigns and evangelist outreach programs designed to make its customers feel as though they're part of a privileged and enlightened elite. One unnamed loser at Slate says today's V-iPod news made her want to rush out and buy one, even though she already owns two iPods, one of which she bought three weeks ago.</blockquote>

It's true.  We aren't any cooler if we buy, on the first day of its release, a product that's been marketed to us through every imaginable avenue, especially if we already own one more earlier versions of the <i>same product</i>.  In fact, that behavior might even be considered <i>un</i>cool.

Shafer also links to this wonderful web site for <a href="http://www.aboyandhiscomputer.com/show.php?ItemID=2204">iProduct</a>, the ultimate commentary on Apple fetishism.
