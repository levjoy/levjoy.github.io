<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">If the business of America is business, then the business of American business is advertising. Installing and maintaining a robust infrastructure that can handle the needs of your customers is expensive. <a href="http://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/02/gallery-super-bowl-ads/">Super Bowl ad time</a> is cheap by comparison. And <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/02/iphone-verizon-sucks/">redefining <em>unlimited</em> to mean <em>limited</em></a> is free!</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/02/alt-text-verizon-att/">wired.com</a></div><br /><p>Wired&#8217;s Lore Sj√∂berg is <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/02/alt-text-verizon-att/">annoyed</a> at the barbs being traded by Verizon and AT&amp;T, now that each carrier is selling the iPhone. <br /></p><p>Sure, it&#8217;s generally annoying to have to be subjected to ad campaigns designed to convince you how terrible a competing cell phone carrier is. <br /></p><p>But there&#8217;s an important key word in that last sentence &#8212; &#8220;competing.&#8221; <br /></p><p>For the first time ever, two cell phone companies are trying to sell you an iPhone. They&#8217;re marketing is not just based on the fact that they <em>have </em> an iPhone, but also on the argument that their service &#8212; or pricing plans &#8212; is superior to the other guys&#8217;. That&#8217;s a good thing.<br /></p><p>This is why competition is good, and hardware exclusivity agreements are frustrating &#8212; they remove the incentive for carriers to compete over service, allowing them to overcharge for underpowered service. <br /></p><p>Such agreements allow carriers to hold new, innovative phones hostage, using them to lure customers &#8212; like 21st century Hansels and Gretels &#8212; into their candy house.  <br /></p><p>Now, there&#8217;s another witch in another forest with an equally tasty candy house. It&#8217;s more choice than we had before.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-5940988381677255229?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
