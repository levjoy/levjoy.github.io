    Just a note to say that Nicole and I are expecting a little one, our first, this October.  Many of you probably know this already, but busy schedules and crazy lives have kept me away from some friends for much longer than I would like, and I haven't yet had a chance to tell everyone.

We just had the 20-week ultrasound and the little guy/girl looks like this:

</div>


The baby is due in the second of week of October, and we won't be finding out the sex.  (Sometimes I slip and tell people, "we won't be finding out the gender.")

Needless to say, we're thrilled.
