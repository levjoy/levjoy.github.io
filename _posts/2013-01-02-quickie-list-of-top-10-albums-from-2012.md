I wrote these down in about five minutes. There's probably a lot missing but here's what came to mind:

1. Grizzly Bear, <em>Shields</em>
Best record of the year.

2. Beach House, <em>Bloom</em>
Second best record of the year.

3. Tame Impala, <em>Lonerism</em>
That's ONE DUDE playing everything.

4. Father John Misty, <em>Fear Fun</em>
Ex-Fleet Foxes drummer, sarcastic but great songs.

5. Lambchop, <em>Mr. M</em>
Return to form.

6. Metz, <em>Metz</em>
Crushing. Jesus Lizard/Melvins/Big Black awesomeness.

7. Lotus Plaza,<em> Spooky Action at a Distance</em>
Deerhunter guitar player/indie heartthrob Lockett Pundt does his best Ride impression.

8. The Fresh &amp; Onlys, <em>Yes or No</em>
Best Echo &amp; the Bunnymen impression of the year.

9. Goat, <em>World Music</em>
Freaky, melodic, amazing.

10. James Levy &amp; the Blood Red Rose, <em>Pray to Be Free</em>
He's my brother.
