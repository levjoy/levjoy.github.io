<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Telecom companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T want to treat the wireless Internet differently than the wired Internet.  But it is not different.  It is the same Internet, just accessed by different networks and different devices.  It shouldn’t matter how you get there, the Internet should operate under one set of rules.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/15/wireless-not-different-half-open/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">techcrunch.com</a></div><br /><p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Eric Schonfeld gets one big problem about the Google-Verizon deal right: You can&#8217;t create Net Neutrality rules for the wireline Internet, and completely abandon wireless, which everyone agrees is, er, the FUTURE OF THE INTERNET. <br /></p><p>But Schonfeld is wrong that a Google and Verizon&#8217;s proposed rules are a &#8220;step forward.&#8221; The truth is, this proposal includes gaping loopholes that would allow Googizen to create a two-tiered Internet: a fast lane for those who can afford it, and a slow lane for everyone else. Not so neutral. <br /></p><p>But it&#8217;s good that Schonfeld&#8217;s keeping the wireless neutrality theme alive. Water, rinse, repeat: We must enact rules keeping the mobile web open or else the future of the Internet is doomed.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-3971610857800378954?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
