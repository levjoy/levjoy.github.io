I stopped by the UN today to visit my friend Carlos and he gave me a tour.  We ate in the employee restaurant, saw a bunch of meeting rooms, and spent some time in the General Assembly.  I think I could be a good ambassador.

The best thing, though, was watching the France vs. Spain World Cup game at the cafe in the basement.  A ton of French and Spanish diplomats and UN workers were there, cheering their respective teams on.  I felt like I was somewhere between Madrid and Paris, not on the corner of 1st Avenue and 45th Street.
