With less than thirty days to go before I present my thesis project, I've been getting down to business.  Last night I more or less completed another chapter of my "Better World in Second Life" (is that really the title?) series of videos about social and political activism in Second Life.  You can go <a href="http://levjoy.com/betterworld/?page_id=18">here</a> to watch it on it's home site.  Beware -- that site is being totally redone and some of it is quite sloppy at the moment.
