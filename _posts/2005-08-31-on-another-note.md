On another note, it's "World Blog Day" today, an event thought up by Israeli blogger <a href="http://niro.typepad.com/spark_armada/2005/06/blog_day_2005.html" target="_blank">Nir Ofir</a> after he saw that "3108" (the way today's date is written everywhere but America) looks a little like the word "blog."  His idea was to have bloggers link to five blogs they've never seen before.  Since I'm pressed for time and ideas, I thought I'd link to five world bloggers who I read and like and haven't mentioned much here.  Here goes:

<a href="http://velveteenrabbi.blogs.com/blog/" target="_blank">Velveteen Rabbi</a> An ethical, interesting blogger who writes about Judaism in a refreshing, open-hearted way. 

<a href="http://el-oso.net/blog" target="_blank">El Oso, El Moreno, and El Abogado</a> David Sasaki is on the <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.com">Global Voices</a> team and writes his own blog which mixes "bridge-blogging" with talk about music and his life. 

<a href="http://www.davidsirota.com/" target="_blank">Sirotablog</a> David Sirota is my good friend Tim's good friend and writes a very necessary and entertaining blog about progressive politics. 

<a href="http://www.meskelsquare.com/" target="_blank">Meskel Square </a> An expatriate in Ethiopia posts photos and talks about life as an outsider. 

<a href="http://headheeb.blogmosis.com/" target="_blank">The Head Heeb</a> A refreshingly liberal and open-minded Jewish blogger who talks about Israel <i>and</i> the developing world, a too-rare combination. 

Happy World Blog Day!
