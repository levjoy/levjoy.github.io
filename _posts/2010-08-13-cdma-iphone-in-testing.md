<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">N92 is &#8220;certainly not in production,&#8221; but is currently at the engineering verification test level, or EVT, according to Gruber. That&#8217;s one level below DVT, or device verification test. And that is itself a level below an actual product currently being manufactured.</blockquote><br /><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-20013469-260.html">news.cnet.com</a></div><br /><p>Is the Verizon iPhone coming or not? Will it change everything? Again? <br /></p><p>So many questions. And still: Android phones, in the aggregate, are outselling iPhones. <br /></p><p>Still more questions: Are all those Android users jonesing for iPhones but on the wrong networks, or can there be &#8212; gasp! &#8212; something compelling about Android that makes people prefer it over iOS? (I, for one, prefer it completely). <br /></p><p>One unscientific, slightly unrelated anecdote: My mother-in-law returned her iPhone 4 after one day, complaining of terrible reception.  She got herself a Samsung Galaxy (not the greatest, IMHO) and loves it.</p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-8992303830122032179?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
