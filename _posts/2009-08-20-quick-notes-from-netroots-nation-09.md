Last Sunday I arrived back at Hartford airport (yep, that's the home airport now) after a fun and fast four days in Pittsburgh at the Netroots Nation conference.  

It was yet another moment to hang out with the traveling pack of online campaigners and progressives I'm proud to know. It was four days of panels, drinks, and the constant talking of shop. For us that means Twitter, Facebook, emailing, crowdsourcing, astroturfing, videomaking, petitioning, and general all-around campaigning. It's always a great time, even if there's never any water or snacks to be found and the organizers always seem to find the largest, most-oversized venues possible in which to stage these pinko events. 

A few highlights:

- Seeing Andy Cobb's fantastic parody of the Washington Post's ill-fated Mouthpiece Theatre disaster for what felt like the 50th time.  And meeting Andy Cobb.

- Watching Bill Clinton get questioned by bloggers.

Well, not really "questioned."  But there were a few questions in the heckling.  

- Pittsburgh.  What a wonderful city! Even the Kinko's guys were beyond nice. 

- Representing Free Press. It was great to be able to be a Free Presser here - with an actual mission - instead of looking for people to hire to trying to figure out who the cool kids were.  I think Free Press is one of the cool kids. 

- Seeing all of my friends.  Ever since attending RootsCamp 2006, I've gotten to know a ton of wonderful, inspiring people who put their all into their work.  Seeing them a few times a year always energizes me and makes me want to work harder and be better at the work I do. 

- Feeling good knowing I was going home to Northampton, MA.  If you'd told me a year or two ago that this was my home I would have laughed.  But that's where the hippies live! I would have said.  Yet here I am.
