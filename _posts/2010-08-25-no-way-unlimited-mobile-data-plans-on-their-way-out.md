<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">According to an international survey of 391 mobile industry executives in 55 countries, including the United States, many want to move away from flat-rate pricing for data services and start charging for the amount of information that is transmitted, much in the way that long-distance telephone callers used to pay by the minute. Users who download more movies or spend more time on the Internet would tend to pay more if that happens.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/08/25/end_of_fixed_price_data_plans_may_be_near/">boston.com</a></div><br /><p>Shocker: Wireless industry execs want to squeeze every last penny out of mobile users via data caps.</p><br /><p>I know this &#8220;news&#8221; comes from the Boston Globe&#8217;s business section, but would it be so hard to ask actual, breathing customers about their data habits and needs?
