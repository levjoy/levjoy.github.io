When i used to bitch and moan in high school or college, my mother would often tell me to shush up and enjoy because "these are the best times of your life." I used to snort at this comment in the same way that i used to roll my eyes whenever she started anything with "when i was your age..." or when she'd tell me that she understood. Yes, i was that pre-emo child who thought that no one could ever understand.

She's been disappointed by the poor behavior of so many people who she thought she could look up to.  I know the feeling.
