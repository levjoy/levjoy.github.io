<p />We spent the weekend in Montauk and it was beautiful.  I love beaches in the winter.  They're so calm and deserted.  And the waves were amazing.  Someone told me that they're supposed to look like horse heads and manes as they sweep across the horizon.  They kind of do.  I couldn't help but think we were on the set of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind while we were there.
