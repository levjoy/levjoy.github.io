<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><br /><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Soon, all those cable channels will be replaced by virtual digital segments of a single all-purpose fast pipe to the home, providing voice, video &amp; data across one connection.  If you’re writing a new app or developing a new online service, you should be worried:  There’s no guarantee that whatever you’re doing will work.</blockquote><br /><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/09/11/comcasts-nbc-u-dreams-may-be-online-videos-nightmare/">gigaom.com</a></div><br /><p>Susan Crawford writes that, if current trends continue and Washington doesn&#8217;t step in, big media mergers &#8212; like Comcast&#8217;s proposed takeover of NBC &#8212; will reach a fever pitch and we&#8217;ll soon have no choice for data providers. These monopolists will also be content providers, with business models designed to shut out the little guys.</p><br /><p>Without Net Neutrality, there&#8217;s nothing to stop this the dystopian future from rolling all over us. Crawford&#8217;s call to action: Pay attention to what&#8217;s happening to our media system.</p><br /><p>This is an insanely important post. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/09/11/comcasts-nbc-u-dreams-may-be-online-videos-nightmare/">Read it</a>.</p><br /><p>P.S. Read my friend Nancy Scola&#8217;s <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_internet_is_not_a_tuna_sandwich">Q&amp;A with Susan Crawford</a> at the American Prospect. It&#8217;s the clearest description yet of why we should care about Net Neutrality and keeping the Internet open. </p><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-4994918265771113081?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>
