Who is actually surprised that Kate Moss got caught doing coke?  We (or the people who speak for us) always affect this "surprise" when stars are caught doing the very things we expect of them.  Who believes that models don't do coke? It's so funny that H&amp;M dropped her because of that stunt; as if the rest of their models don't do any drugs.  They, like the rest of us, pretend to be surprised at her behavior.  Oh my, Kate Moss doesn't eat?  Who knew?

The bigger question, of course, is if she's still hot in light of this behavior.
