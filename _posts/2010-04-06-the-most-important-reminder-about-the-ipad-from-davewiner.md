      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">No matter how great a new computer is, as long as you're still you, the experience doesn't change. It's fun to play with new toys, I do lots of that and it's important to me. No sarcasm. But reading a book that changes my perspective, or meeting someone who opens a door for me, that really <i>does</i> change the game -- much more than using a new device. If you're looking for game-changers look into yourself, that's where change comes from.&nbsp;</blockquote>
