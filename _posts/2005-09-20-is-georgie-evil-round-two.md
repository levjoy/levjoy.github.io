First of all, thanks to <a href="http://www.gawker.com">Gawker</a> for finding <a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/new-york-times/we-are-still-looking-for-a-safe-legal-alternative-to-david-brooks-126250.php">ways to circumvent</a> the Times' asinine new subscription service.  And they link to a <a href="http://pkarchive.org/column/091905.html">fantastic article</a> by Krugman about Georgie and race that a Paul Krugman fansite(!) published.  Check it out and let's keep finding new ways to get around the Times' self-imposed banishment from the online world.  

The Krugman article is the best thing I've read about Bushie and race and why his administration has been so terrible in its response to Katrina.  To answer my question from an earlier post, and to paraphrase Krugman, Bushie isn't evil, he just surrounds himself with evil people.
