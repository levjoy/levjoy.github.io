Along with <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2009/01/20/sardines-and-beets-seriously/">beets and sardines</a>, my new passion (at least in a future-looking, hopeful kind of way) is gardening.  Maybe inspired by the <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1301/824103180_c55d9fe34b_m.jpg">beautiful, lush lawns in Ditmas Park</a> or by the romance of the contemporary back-to-the-land locavore movement, I want to grow my own pumpkins, green beans, and tomatoes, and to be able to say that I grew them in Brooklyn. 

Thankfully, the folks at <a href="http://sustainableflatbush.org/">Sustainable Flatbush</a> are thinking the same thing, and last year they got started on a community garden.  Turns out demand for a plot is so high that I have to be on a damn <em>waiting list</em>, but that's fine -- I mostly want a chance to get my hands away from the keyboard and buried in some dirt.  The way this Ditmas garden is run, you can always get your hands dirty even if you don't have your own plot.  Ah, dirt. 

So starting in March, I might get my wish.  And yes, I will be wearing my Crocs while gardening. 

Now for the big question: what should I grow?
