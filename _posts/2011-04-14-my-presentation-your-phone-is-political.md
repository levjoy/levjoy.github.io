<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">  <p>If you couldn&#8217;t make my panel on mobile democracy at the National Conference for Media Reform last week &#8212; and even if you could &#8212; check out my <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/52643951/Your-Phone-Is-Political">presentation</a>. It&#8217;s a good synopsis of how &#8220;mobile phones are essential tools for engaging in politics, newsgathering and community organizing&#8221; both here in the U.S. and across the world.</p>  <p>Would love to hear your thoughts.</p>  </div></div>
