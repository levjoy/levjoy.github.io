<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678211.stm">This one</a> happened yesterday, and it's horrifying.  At least 56 people were killed when gunman attacked a village in Kenya.  "One mother told of how the gunmen killed her two children and beheaded her husband while she watched," reported the BBC.  

This is a horrible event that killed more people than the bombings in London last week.  Yet the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, and others failed to even mention it. 

They did mention the collision of three commuter trains in Pakistan and the 27 (mostly children!) killed in a suicide attack in Baghdad.  Maybe they were suffering from horrifying-death-by-militants-or-accidents fatigue?  

Oh yeah, Brad Pitt was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms.
