It had been almost **20 years** (!) since I'd played in a band -- and since playing in bands was my life -- and a couple of years ago I started playing with Peter, Noam, and Anand in the Capitulators. It has been a thrill to play exciting and challenging music with good friends bring serious chops to the table.

This week we finally released our EP. I think it's really good! But check it out for yourself: [https://thecapitulators.bandcamp.com/releases](http://)
