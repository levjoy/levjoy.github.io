Earlier this year, <a href="http://radioopensource.org">Radio Open Source</a> -- the first public radio show to utilize the input of online communities -- went on a "summer hiatus" after losing its funding source.&nbsp; It was a major disappointment for those of us charmed by Christopher Lydon's whimsical looks at life and culture and his big thinking about building online conversations.&nbsp; <br /><br />But times are better. The show has found new funding and a <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/as-we-were-saying/">new home</a> at the Watson Institute at Brown University. &nbsp; <br /><br />Congrats and good luck to Lydon and producer Mary McGrath!<br /> <br /><br />
