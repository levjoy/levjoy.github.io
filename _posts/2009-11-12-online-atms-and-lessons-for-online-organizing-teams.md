<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The  new media group (online communications, Web-page development and maintenance, texting) in most campaigns reports to the communications department, and its department head is not considered an equal of other senior staff.

To find us new talent we enlisted one of Barack's law school classmates, <strong>Julius Genachowski</strong>, who was steeped in the technology world. He identified our director of new media, <strong>Joe Rospars</strong>, a veteran of <strong>Howard Dean's</strong> revolutionary new media effort in 2004. Joe seemed to relish the challenge of marrying digital technology and strategy with a strong grassroots campaign.</blockquote>
