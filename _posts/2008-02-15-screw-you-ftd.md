<p>Two days ago I ordered flowers for Nicole on FTD.com. I figured they should be pretty reliable -- when I think of flowers I think of FTD; and I buy stuff online all the time.<br /></p>
<p>Nothing was further from the truth.</p>
<p>All day yesterday -- Valentine's Day -- I waited for word from her that flowers had arrived at her office. She works in Harlem and, while there are flower shops throughout the city, I had a feeling that deliverers would wait until the end of the day to make it up by her.</p>
<p>But by late afternoon I heard nothing. So I asked her about it, spilling the beans in the process. Immediately after, I called FTD to see what the hell was going on, since I had now gotten Nicole nothing for Valentine's Day. I was greeting with a recording that told me something to the effect of, "Due to high holiday call volume, no one can take your call. Please go to the web site."</p>
<p>So I went to the site and filled out a form with my confirmation number and name. I was told I'd get an email as soon as they had word from the florist who was delivering my flowers. But the rest of the day ticked by and I heard nothing. By last night it was obvious that I had nothing to show for Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nicole got me socks and chocolate.</p>
<p>Today (2/15), she still hadn't received anything and I hadn't heard back. I called again and got the same asinine recording, so I again filled out the web form. This time, a couple of hours later, I heard back:</p>

<p>No wonder you can't deliver my product on 2/14 -- not unless you know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Brown">Doc Brown</a> and have access to his Delorean!</p>
<p>I love that they're asking me to visit www.ftd.com/love to get $10 off future purchases.</p>
<p>If you go to the <a href="http://www.ftd.com/">FTD site</a> you'll see a banner telling you that you have a "Second Chance for Romance!" Not with FTD I don't.</p>
