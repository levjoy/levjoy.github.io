    <p>I’ve inadvertently devoted the last week to eating fish.  Since last Friday I’ve eaten arctic char once, sardines twice, and the other night I cooked up some delicious trout for me and the missus. (As a rule, the missus doesn’t like fish.  I know, it’s a major strike, but thankfully she has so many things going for her it doesn’t matter.)</p>

<p>You’re probably very worried about my mercury levels, but while I may be like Jeremy Piven in some important ways, my mercury count isn’t one of them.</p>

<p>That’s in part because small fish like sardines are considered <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish">fairly safe</a> and are actually <a href="http://www.plentymag.com/events/2008/07/sardines.php">somewhat sustainable</a>. Since I don’t eat other kinds of meat and need to keep on eye on the protein intake, I’m focusing on the little shiny guys.</p>

<p>But you already <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/blog/2009/01/20/sardines-and-beets-seriously/">knew that.</a></p>

<p>Beyond sardines, then, it’s time to look at what other fish I can eat that a) won’t make me sick or give me brain damage, b) aren’t being overfished or caught in habitat-wrecking trawlers, and c) taste good.</p>

<p>It seems like this would be an easy decision to make, but it’s just not.  As Jeremey Piven discovered, too much tuna will make you unfit to act on Broadway; wild salmon is <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish/seafood/seafood-guide/wild-caught-alaskan-salmon">apparently safe</a> but farmed salmon, like most farmed fish, is full of feces and antibiotics and chemicals and other pollutants; catfish is tasty, but nasty (though domestically farmed catfish is apparently better than foreign catfish); shrimp is one of the <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish/publications/reports/suspicious-shrimp">worst offenders</a>; and most other fish are either overfished, overfarmed, full of mercury, or all of the above.</p>

<p>I’d thought that trout was my savior – the label at Fairway says it’s sustainable! – but alas, Food and Water Watch tells me <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/fish/fish-farming/inland/united-states/?searchterm=trout">it ain’t so</a>:</p>
<blockquote>However, production of the second leading species of farmed fish raises environmental concerns. Water flushes through concrete raceways at a rate of 500 to 2,000 gallons per minute before discharging into a collecting pond.<sup>11</sup> Like other in-tensive food production systems, <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">trout</span> farming uses chemicals to increase output. To prevent fungus from growing on <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">trout</span> eggs operators use a formaldehyde solution, called formalin, which is potentially carcinogenic to humans.<sup>2,12</sup> Additionally, <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">trout</span> farmers commonly use the antibiotics oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine ormetoprim, and florfenicol to treat bacterial diseases, raising concerns about antibiotic resistance.<sup>6</sup>

<span class="highlightedSearchTerm">Trout</span> aquaculture relies heavily on wild fish to use as feed. A close relative of salmon, <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">trout</span> need high levels of fishmeal, produced from ground wild fish, in their diet. It takes about 3 pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of farmed <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">trout</span>.</blockquote>
<p>That’s too bad, because that trout I mentioned I’d made earlier this week? It was delicious, sprinkled with basil and breadcrumbs with just a touch of a drizzle of a smattering of olive oil.  Sigh.</p>

<p>So what the heck can I eat?  I admit to stretching it a bit when I tell people that I’m a vegetarian. It’s true that most days I get my protein from tofu, pulses, and eggs.  But I grew up in a fish-eating house and fish has always occupied a middle ground between a luxury good and an earthy, no-nonsense food.  Also, I get the sneaking suspicion that the protein I get from it – in addition to the Omega-3s which will apparently make me live forever – is a bit… purer.  Whatever that means.  In any case, I don’t plan on giving it up, even though I know that fish are sentient beings (despite appearances sometimes indicating otherwise).</p>

<p>So for now the answer comes down to sardines and other small fish, as well as locally-caught mollusks.  Good for me, and bad for Nicole, who actually gets mad at me for unleashing the smell of sardines into the precious atmosphere of our apartment.</p>
