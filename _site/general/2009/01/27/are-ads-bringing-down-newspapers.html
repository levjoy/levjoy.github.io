    <p>The inimitable Ethan Zuckerman, a true renaissance man if I’ve ever seen one, just wrote an important – and mildly depressing – post on the <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/01/16/is-ad-supported-journalism-viable-in-a-pay-for-performance-age/">state of print advertising</a>.</p>

<p>After providing a useful education in the history of online advertising strategies (and the best description of impression-based ads vs. pay-per-click that I’ve read), Ethan gets concerned that the prices of print advertising are wildly inflated, thanks to the difficulty in gauging its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Ad inserts in Ethan’s hometown paper are priced, in internet terms, at about $45 CPMs:</p>

<blockquote>Advertising inserts in the Berkshire Eagle are priced at a base rate of $45 per thousand customers for two print pages, targeted by zipcode. Those prices don’t include production costs - the advertiser is responsible producing the inserts and delivering them to the production facility. The cost covers the insertion of the ad into the appropriate papers and their delivery.</blockquote>

<p>This is an very high advertising rate.  With a few exceptions, that kind of rate faded away from the web some time ago, most likely because when you can track click-throughs, you see the true value of these ads, and that value is less than print publishers claim it is.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<blockquote>Here’s my concern. If I’m right and print advertising costs are fundamentally irrational, then it’s possible that the way we’ve built media in the United States can’t survive a transition to a more rational market. That would be bad. Newspapers aren’t just businesses - they serve a critical function in a democratic society, informing citizens so they can make intelligent voting decisions, lobby their elected representatives on issues of their concern and hold political and business powers accountable.</blockquote>

<p>Are newspapers going to crash like the stock market did, much for the same reason?  Unlike many of my fellow techies, I will miss print.  I think online news and print newspapers can coexist somehow, and seeing the print news industry go down for inflated ads costs would be a shame.</p>

<p>But the internet is the ultimate vacuum, and whatever we lose in the newspaper crash would no doubt be recovered online, probably in a more innovative way.</p>
