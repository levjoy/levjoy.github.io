    <p>I can’t make up my mind about this.  I go back and forth.  On low days, when I’m convinced the world is ending, I tell myself that George is  the source of all evil, that he even makes our shit stink.  On better days, when I’m being generous, I view him as a kind of willful ignoramus, satisfied to surround himself with sycophants who shield him from the truth and from the results of his carelessness.</p>

<p>On the low days I feel like he’s not only ignorant of matters of race in America, but that he’s actively against the equality of non-whites.</p>

<p>On other days I tell myself that he doesn’t really hate black people, he’s just honestly believes that his policies work best for everyone, including minorities.  You can’t hate someone who has good intentions, right?</p>

<p>It’s been a low day for some time.  Because I’m inclined to equate him with Lucifer, today I think that George Bush knows that many Americans have this sort of struggle about his eviltude, and he is able to give speeches like last night’s (I confess that I didn’t actually see it, but I heard about it) in which, by taking responsibility for his administration’s inaction, he’s able to convince people that he cares, that his heart’s in the right place even if it’s a little misguided.  He did the same thing after 9/11, and I wanted to believe him.</p>

<p>But then he went and invaded Iraq, using forged evidence and misinformation and a contempt for the international community to do it.  And then we were all reminded of his hatred for a government that actually cares for people and that works on their behalf, not on the behalf of corporate interests.  I could continue, but if you’re reading this you probably know this stuff already.</p>

<p>Yet his humanness gets to me.  After all, if he stands at a bottomless pit of magma-soaked Satanity, he couldn’t be human.  Humans, I tell myself, have a conscience and aren’t capable of actual Evil.  Not to compare Georgie with Hitler (really, it’s just not the same), but this is the exact issue that theologians and historians have been dealing with when studying Adolf: if he’s actually evil incarnate, how can he be human?</p>

<p>So it goes with Georgie.  He must have remorse for the terror he’s wrought in Iraq, for the way he continues to endanger this country rather than protect it, and for his pathetic inaction following Katrina.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>So I’m asking you, all three readers, to tell me: Is George Bush actually evil or does he just do evil things because he’s an idiot?
