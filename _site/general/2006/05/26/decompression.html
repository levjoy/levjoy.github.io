    <p>Sometimes you don’t realize how compressed you are until after the fact, when you deflate.  Case in point: after a long semester of working on and thinking about nothing but the <a href="http://www.bronxblogproject.org">Bronx Blog Project</a> – obsessing over the web site’s design and functionality, shooting, editing, and compressing video, slaving with Flash for over a week for a minor component of the site, coordinating shoots, battling administrative bureaucracies, and constantly rethinking the PR aspect so as many people as possible “got” it – I was completely burnt out.
I’m in an MFA program, which in our case means that we have to present our work at a “crit” twice during our tenure.   So last week, as I feverishly prepared a Keynote presentation (Keynote is kind of like Apple’s answer to Powerpoint, and it’s very fun) that used the brilliant insights I made in my <a href="http://www.levjoy.com/essaywiki">Social Software for Social Change</a> essay to contextualize the work I did in the Bronx over the last few months, I realized that my precious, precarious mental state was becoming unbalanced.  I wasn’t alone; Nicole was glued to her papers and computers all weekend too, working herself into a frenzy of public-healthified indignance.  Cries and whoops could be heard from time to time as she came across more and more evidence of the fast-food industry’s nefarious hold on minority consumers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I worked hard on a presentation that included pictures like this:
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/94755749@N00/153793881"> <img width="245" height="140" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/153793881_a657ccc6e0_d.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I might have gone a little overboard on the cartoonishness, but it was fun.
All I wanted was a break from the project, and some kind of closure.  Then I presented to a welcoming and supportive crit panel, who had loads of positive things to say and very little criticism.  For the first time in months, I felt people got what I was doing, and they seemed to understand why I thought it was important, and they might have thought it was important too.  In part, that could be a result of my Tony Robbins-like presentation style, in which my body language seems to be telling people that, if they just do what I say, their lives will improve forever.
Anyway, after I left school that day, I felt an amazing sense of well-being and realized that I hadn’t felt that way without the help of beer in months.  A cloud had lifted that I didn’t even know was there.  I’d been tied in a <strike>know</strike> knot all semester and it became untied.  Cliche after cliche entered my mind.  Only after I finally had some closure on the project did I feel unbound by it.
So I’ve been listening to the new <a href="http://www.marcata.net/walkmen/">Walkmen</a> album constantly all week, rocking out and feeling free.  Yay.
