<p>That was a boring sentence.</p>

<p>After my bout with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/levjoy/80671134/">pink eye</a> I thought infirmity was leaving me for a while, but instead I caught a bad cold on the trip.  I stayed in North Quincy the night before our shoot and ate a bunch of red wine and drank too much cheese (?).  I woke up the next morning with a vicious sore throat, the kind that usually functions as the shout of the Cold Army as it prepares for attack, but I shrugged it off. This morning the battalion arrived and I’m hurting.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://notmuch.blogsome.com/2006/01/04/sad/">Rosanne</a> picked up on something that, before the pink invaded my brain, I might have picked up on too:</p>

<blockquote>it’s not too surprising that watching the news about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060104/ap_on_re_us/mine_explosion">those miners in west virginia</a> this morning made me cry.  but what is it about this particular situation that makes it hit me so hard?  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060104/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq">53 people died in Iraq yesterday</a>.  is it the old-fashionedness?  how can miners be trapped in 2006?  we dont die this way anymore.</blockquote>
<p>If I was feeling cold-hearted (pun intended) I would say that, yet again, we have become completely numb to such a large number of deaths in Iraq yet feel pain when faced with a smaller number here at home.  But it’s understandable, I think, because of what Rosanne said: miner deaths aren’t supposed to happen anymore, are they? This makes me think of the great John Sayles movie <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0093509/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9bWF0ZXdhbnxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=20">Matewan</a></em>, in which there are fierce battles between West Virginian mine owners and the miners who want to unionize.  There is death and violence.</p>

<p>That film made me pretty much hate the mine owners. And I wonder if folks down in West Virginia are blaming the owners for these recent deaths – the false news of 12 live men first originated from the owners.</p>

<p>Tonight = soup.</p>
