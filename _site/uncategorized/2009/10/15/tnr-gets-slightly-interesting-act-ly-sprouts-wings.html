<ul>
  <li>The New Republic has, somewhat surprisingly, published not one but two pieces that made it on my radar this week. (I say surprisingly because TNR almost <em>never </em>makes it out of the Beltway and into my general awarenesss; I don’t think I’m alone).</li>
</ul>

<p>One was Jeffrey Rosen’s <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/net-cemetery">Net Cemetery</a>, an excellent overview of Net Neutrality for noobs. Rosen focused on the Comcast case in which the FCC punished the telecom giant for blocking peer-to-peer activity on its network. That case is ongoing, so keep a lookout for it.</p>

<p>The other piece is a <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/against-transparency?page=0,1">piece against transparency</a> (you read that right), by none other than Lawrence Lessig, who argues that the movement for transparency in government might not be the panacea it purports to be.</p>

<p>Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">These [transparency in government] projects assume that they are seeking an obvious good. No doubt they will have a profound effect. But will the effect of these projects--at least on their own, unqualified or unrestrained by other considerations--really be for the good? Do we really want the world that they righteously envisage?</blockquote>
<p>These are fine questions. <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/against-transparency?page=0,1">Read on</a> for Lessig’s answers. In short, Lessig fears that transparency will unleash more bad than good, mistaking “reform” for what is really best for the public.</p>

<p>If you want a shorter, more biblical version, try <a href="http://perplexed.jottit.com/">this</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I cried with laughter while watching <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2009/october/graphic-designer-vs-client">this video</a>, which used Xtra Normal, software that lets you marry a script to animation. The video describes the encounter between a graphic designer and his client, from the designer’s POV. I can sympathize, though I wince at the thought of which side I’m usually on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/23150">great article</a> by Michael Tomasky about the rise of the conservatives Tea Partiers.  Lots of wisdom in there, and lots to be afraid of.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally: <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/can-petition-tweets-change-world-actly-quarterly-report">can tweets change the world</a>? If Jim Gilliam has anything to do about it, then maybe it can. My pal Nancy Scola describes the evolution of Gilliam’s <a href="http://act.ly">act.ly</a> – a wonderful Twitter petition site – and through an exhaustive list of usage scenarios and users, makes it clear that Gilliam’s idea is just now starting to sprout wings. Fly, little act.ly, fly.</p>
