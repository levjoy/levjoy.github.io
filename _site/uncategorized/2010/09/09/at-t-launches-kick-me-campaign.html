    <p>[Update: More quotes below]</p>
<p><br />&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T just launched a PR blitz using every flack’s weapon of choice: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ATT">Facebook</a>. The site was announced via emails “sent” by AT&amp;T execs to consumers, promising an investment of $18-$19 billion in wireless and wireline networks in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The company’s resident social media guru may have <em>slightly</em> underestimated the absolute blitz of negative comments (TechCrunch calls it a “<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/08/customer-service-in-a-brave-new-world-att-puts-a-finger-in-the-dam/">tower of hate</a>”) this tactic would inspire. See, when you create an online, public platform for comments, <em>you can’t control those comments</em>.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Here’s a glimpse of what consumers are writing: &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“I love the iphone, but AT&amp;T has found a way to ruin my iphone experience. The phone is nearly useless now and either drops every call or the person on the other end can’t hear me.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“So glad I’m not the only one with ATT problems. Recently, I’ve noticed extensive drops on the route from my home to work. This literally just started in the last 6 weeks. I would expect my service to get <em>better</em> over time.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“I am forced to give up my iPhone with AT&amp;T after two years this month. Last week I was in LAX and desperately needed to call a friend to let her know that my flight was cancelled after a five hour mechanical and that I’d be arriving at a much later time and at a different airport in D.C. Many times her phone never rang but the minutes kept running.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“… just two weeks ago I spoke to customer service about constant dropped calls or calls that don’t even go through to begin with (still happening), 1-2 bars most of the time and i’m thinking my phone (yes iphone) is having issues. I call customer service and the representative tells me that there is nothing wrong with my phone.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;To be fair, there’s a sprinkling of goodwill mixed in. But for the most part, folks are just being honest: AT&amp;T’s service sucks. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<br />&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some more from later in the day — these are all from within the last 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“Kinda sucks that you have to ‘like’ AT&amp;T before you can talk about what you don’t like. Let me be clear — AT&amp;T still exists because of the iPhone!”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“While everything you have said in you latest email is encouraging…. the coverage that AT&amp;T provides for phone service is AWFUL!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“I too find if comical that AT&amp;T has asked for the public’s opinion. Look—when it works it works and then the only issue really is that AT&amp;T has been gouging us for this and for that.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“Hi, I own the iPhone 3Gs. Every since the Iphone 4 was released, my husband and I keep getting dropped calls and hardly ever get a good cellular signal anymore. We live in the Chicago area and normally service was good…”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“Coverage is crap in san Francisco! I get better service in the middle of the ocean in Hawaii than in one of the biggest cities!”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;“Response to letter from ‘Chris Penrose’ - After moving to Magnolia TX, my service has been more than terrible. Numerous calls to customer service, dropped calls, no service at times.”&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;<img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8920950033468593796-2164618180366330807?l=openmobile.blogspot.com" alt="" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
