We all knew this was coming.<br /></p><p>I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about this development. Frankly, I use very few &#8220;apps&#8221; these days anyway, other than the trusty web browser. I still use Microsoft Office for some document processing, but I&#8217;m increasingly replacing it with Google Docs. I still use Pidgin, and, well, iTunes. At work I use Outlook for email, but I hate it with a passion. I run an anti-virus program. And that&#8217;s it for my 3rd party software consumption. The web is still alive and kicking on desktops, at least.<br /></p><p>Also, everyday users have had numerous headaches, for years, dealing with independent software - it leaves things running and eating memory, installs and removals are a pain, etc. An App Store model simplifies that and eases the process of trying out innovative new software (even developed by an individual, rather than a big company) for a broader range of people.<br /></p><p>But at the same time, Apple doesn&#8217;t exactly have a rosy history of open-mindedness in its App Store policies. When users are *forced* to go through Apple to get software, censorship and severe limits to innovation are inevitable. Next thing you know, your broadband company might strike a deal to keep Skype and Vonage not just off your mobile phone, but off your desktop as well. Worse, Microsoft and other companies making a living off of software sure as heck aren&#8217;t going to pay Apple&#8217;s cut of the fees (nor should they be forced to).<br /></p><p>Ultimately, the solution is openness - app stores are great, provided they aren&#8217;t the only option. The device must permit independent software installs, independent tinkering, and the independent and open World Wide Web. We&#8217;re losing our phones on this front, and tablets aren&#8217;t far behind - let&#8217;s make sure we don&#8217;t lose laptops and netbooks too.</p></div>
